Question: is the phone ringing?
End your answer with: ""Answer: yes or no""","To determine whether the phone is ringing, let's analyze the chain of statements:

1. Landry says the phone is ringing.
2. Victoria claims that Landry lies.
3. Kailani claims that Victoria lies.
4. Christopher claims that Kailani lies.
5. Ava claims that Christopher lies.
6. Theo claims that Ava lies.
7. Daniel claims that Theo lies.

We are told that witnesses should be believed unless there is testimony that they might lie. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

- **Daniel** says **Theo** lies, and since no one accuses Daniel of lying, we believe Daniel. Therefore, **Theo** is lying.
- **Theo** (who is lying) claims **Ava** lies. Since Theo is lying, his claim is false, so **Ava** is telling the truth.
- **Ava** (telling the truth) says **Christopher** lies. Therefore, **Christopher** is lying.
- **Christopher** (who is lying) claims **Kailani** lies. Since Christopher is lying, his claim is false, so **Kailani** is telling the truth.
- **Kailani** (telling the truth) says **Victoria** lies. Therefore, **Victoria** is lying.
- **Victoria** (who is lying) claims **Landry** lies. Since Victoria is lying, her claim is false, so **Landry** is telling the truth.
- **Landry** (telling the truth) says the phone is ringing.

Question: is the clock fast?
End your answer with: ""Answer: yes or no""","To solve this reasoning puzzle, we need to evaluate the statements made by each witness and determine their credibility based on the rule: **""Witnesses should be believed unless there is testimony that they might lie.""**

Let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Josie** says that the clock is fast.
2. **Callista** claims that **Josie** lies.
   - Since **Callista** accuses **Josie** of lying, we would doubt **Josie's** statement **only if we believe Callista**.
3. **Penelope** claims that **Callista** lies.
   - **Penelope** accuses **Callista** of lying, casting doubt on **Callista's** credibility.
   - Since there's no testimony against **Penelope**, we believe her, concluding that **Callista** lies.
   - Therefore, **Callista's** claim that **Josie** lies is false, so **Josie** tells the truth.

Continuing with the other witnesses:

4. **Raegan** claims that **Josie** lies.
   - **Raegan** accuses **Josie** of lying, but we need to check **Raegan's** credibility.
5. **Lily** claims that **Raegan** lies.
   - **Lily** casts doubt on **Raegan's** credibility.
   - Since there's no testimony against **Lily**, we believe her, concluding that **Raegan** lies.
   - Therefore, **Raegan's** claim that **Josie** lies is false, so **Josie** tells the truth.

Proceeding further:

6. **Juniper** claims that **Lily** lies.
   - **Juniper** accuses **Lily** of lying.
7. **Zaiden** claims that **Juniper** lies.
   - **Zaiden** accuses **Juniper** of lying.
8. **Raya** claims that **Zaiden** lies.
   - **Raya** accuses **Zaiden** of lying.
9. **Anabella** claims that **Raya** lies.
   - **Anabella** accuses **Raya** of lying.
   - Since there's no testimony against **Anabella**, we believe her, concluding that **Raya** lies.
   - Therefore, **Raya's** claim that **Zaiden** lies is false, so **Zaiden** tells the truth.
   - **Zaiden's** claim that **Juniper** lies is believed, so **Juniper** lies.
   - **Juniper's** claim that **Lily** lies is false, so **Lily** tells the truth.
   - **Lily's** claim that **Raegan** lies is believed, confirming again that **Raegan** lies and **Josie** tells the truth.

In all paths, we conclude that **Josie** tells the truth when she says the clock is fast.

Witness Claire claims that witness Zalia lies.
Witness Noa claims that witness Claire lies.
Witness Sloane claims that witness David lies.
Witness Corinna claims that witness Sloane lies.
Witness Ayla claims that witness Corinna lies.
Question: is the tea hot?
End your answer with: ""Answer: yes or no""","To solve this puzzle, we need to determine who among the witnesses is telling the truth and who is lying, based on the rule that ""witnesses should be believed unless there is testimony that they might lie.""

**Witnesses with No Accusations:**
1. **Anwen**: No one says that Anwen lies. Therefore, Anwen tells the truth.
2. **Noa**: No one says that Noa lies. Therefore, Noa tells the truth.
3. **Ayla**: No one says that Ayla lies. Therefore, Ayla tells the truth.

**Analyses based on Truthful Witnesses:**

1. **Anwen says that Alice lies.**
   - Since Anwen is truthful, **Alice is lying**.

2. **Noa says that Claire lies.**
   - Since Noa is truthful, **Claire is lying**.

3. **Ayla says that Corinna lies.**
   - Since Ayla is truthful, **Corinna is lying**.

**Implications of Liars:**

1. **Alice is lying.**
   - Alice claims that **David lies**.
   - Since Alice is lying, her claim is false.
   - Therefore, **David tells the truth**.

2. **Claire is lying.**
   - Claire claims that **Zalia lies**.
   - Since Claire is lying, her claim is false.
   - Therefore, **Zalia tells the truth**.

3. **Corinna is lying.**
   - Corinna claims that **Sloane lies**.
   - Since Corinna is lying, her claim is false.
   - Therefore, **Sloane tells the truth**.

**Statements from Truthful Witnesses:**

1. **Zalia (truthful) says that David lies.**
2. **Sloane (truthful) says that David lies.**

**Conflict:**

- We have two truthful witnesses (**Zalia** and **Sloane**) saying that **David lies**.
- We have concluded earlier that **David tells the truth** based on Alice's lie.

**Resolution:**

The only way to resolve this contradiction is to recognize that our initial conclusion about David was incorrect.

- Since **Zalia** and **Sloane** (both truthful) say that **David lies**, it must be that **David is lying**.
- **Alice is lying** when she says **David lies**, so the opposite (that David tells the truth) is false.
- But since **other truthful witnesses** say **David lies**, the majority consensus among truthful witnesses is that **David is lying**.

**Conclusion:**

- **David is lying when he says the tea is hot.**
- Therefore, **the tea is not hot**.

Witness Emily claims that witness Landon lies.
Witness Fiera claims that witness Emily lies.

Witness Jack claims that witness Anna lies.
Witness Lucy claims that witness Jack lies.
Witness Anthony claims that witness Lucy lies.
Question: is the book interesting?
End your answer with: ""Answer: yes or no""","To determine whether the book is interesting, we need to analyze the statements of all the witnesses and see if their testimonies lead us to a consistent conclusion.

Here's the breakdown:

1. **Kyra** says the book is **interesting**.
2. **Phoenix** claims that **Kyra lies**.
3. **Zinnia** claims that **Phoenix lies**.
   - No one says that **Zinnia lies**, so we believe her.
   - Therefore, **Phoenix lies**, which means **Kyra tells the truth** (the book is interesting).
4. **Landon** claims that **Kyra lies**.
5. **Emily** claims that **Landon lies**.
6. **Fiera** claims that **Emily lies**.
7. **Anna** claims that **Fiera lies**.
8. **Jack** claims that **Anna lies**.
9. **Lucy** claims that **Jack lies**.
10. **Anthony** claims that **Lucy lies**.
    - No one says that **Anthony lies**, so we believe him.
    - Therefore, **Lucy lies**.
    - Since **Lucy lies**, **Jack tells the truth**.
    - **Jack** says **Anna lies**, so **Anna lies**.
    - Since **Anna lies**, **Fiera tells the truth**.
    - **Fiera** says **Emily lies**, so **Emily lies**.
    - Since **Emily lies**, **Landon tells the truth**.
    - **Landon** says **Kyra lies**, so **Kyra lies** (the book is not interesting).

Now, we have a contradiction:

- From **Zinnia's** unchallenged testimony, **Kyra tells the truth**.
- From **Landon's** testimony (which we've established as truthful), **Kyra lies**.

Since both cannot be true, we must resolve this by considering the number and reliability of the testimonies against **Kyra**.

- **Kyra** is said to lie by **Phoenix** and **Landon**.
  - **Phoenix** is discredited by **Zinnia**, but **Landon**'s testimony remains credible.
- **Kyra** is said to tell the truth based solely on **Zinnia's** discrediting of **Phoenix**.

Given that **Kyra** has more witnesses claiming she lies and only one supporting her indirectly, we conclude that **Kyra lies**.

6. **Jorja says Delilah lies.**
7. **Zinnia says Jorja lies.**
8. **Elara says Delilah lies.**
9. **Dylan says Elara lies.**
10. **Oaklee says Dylan lies.**

Witnesses with no accusations against them are Lydia, Jaylani, Zinnia, and Oaklee. We believe them.

- **Lydia says Soraya lies** ⇒ Soraya is lying when she says Delilah lies ⇒ **Delilah tells the truth.**
- **Jaylani says Alistair lies** ⇒ Alistair is lying when he says Delilah lies ⇒ **Delilah tells the truth.**
- **Zinnia says Jorja lies** ⇒ Jorja is lying when she says Delilah lies ⇒ **Delilah tells the truth.**
- **Oaklee says Dylan lies** ⇒ Dylan is lying when he says Elara lies ⇒ **Elara tells the truth.**

**Elara says Delilah lies** ⇒ Contradicts earlier conclusion that Delilah tells the truth.

This contradiction suggests that we cannot simultaneously hold all our initial assumptions.

However, since witnesses with no testimony against them are to be believed (per the instructions), and the majority of these witnesses support that Delilah tells the truth, we conclude that **Delilah tells the truth** and the floor is slippery.

1. **Renata**: *The fridge is empty.*
2. **Indigo**: *Renata lies.*
3. **Arabelle**: *Indigo lies.*
4. **Jeremiah**: *Arabelle lies.*
5. **Zuri**: *Renata lies.*
6. **Bella**: *Zuri lies.*
7. **Etta**: *Bella lies.*
8. **Angel**: *Etta lies.*
9. **Aurora**: *Angel lies.*
10. **Azalea**: *Aurora lies.*

**Step-by-step analysis:**

1. **Jeremiah (Witness 4)** has no testimony against him. Therefore, we trust **Jeremiah**.

   - **Jeremiah says Arabelle lies**, so **Arabelle** might be lying.

2. Since **Arabelle** might be lying (as per Jeremiah), her statement that **Indigo lies** is unreliable.

   - There is no other testimony against **Indigo**, so we trust **Indigo**.

3. **Indigo says Renata lies**, so **Renata** might be lying.

4. **Azalea (Witness 10)** has no testimony against her. Therefore, we trust **Azalea**.

   - **Azalea says Aurora lies**, so **Aurora** might be lying.

5. Since **Aurora** might be lying (as per Azalea), her statement that **Angel lies** is unreliable.

   - There is no other testimony against **Angel**, so we trust **Angel**.

6. **Angel says Etta lies**, so **Etta** might be lying.

7. Since **Etta** might be lying, her statement that **Bella lies** is unreliable.

   - There is no other testimony against **Bella**, so we trust **Bella**.

8. **Bella says Zuri lies**, so **Zuri** might be lying.

9. Since **Zuri** might be lying, her statement that **Renata lies** is unreliable.

10. Now, **Renata** has one trustworthy witness (**Indigo**) claiming she lies and another untrustworthy witness (**Zuri**) with an unreliable statement about her.

11. Since there's testimony from a trusted witness (**Indigo**) that **Renata lies**, we conclude that **Renata might be lying**.

Let's analyze each chain of testimonies:

- **Nolan vs. William**:
  - **Serenity** says **Nolan lies**.
  - There's no testimony against **Serenity**, so we believe her.
  - Therefore, **Nolan** is lying.
  - Since **Nolan** lies about **William**, **William** is telling the truth in this context.

- **Luke vs. William**:
  - **Ivan** says **Luke lies**.
  - There's no testimony against **Ivan**, so we believe him.
  - Therefore, **Luke** is lying.
  - Since **Luke** lies about **William**, **William** is telling the truth in this context.

- **Azalea vs. William**:
  - **Colton** says **Azalea lies**.
  - There's no testimony against **Colton**, so we believe him.
  - Therefore, **Azalea** is lying.
  - Since **Azalea** lies about **William**, **William** is telling the truth in this context.

- **Elaine vs. William**:

2. **Madison** claims Melina lies. Since there's no testimony against Madison, we believe her. So, Melina lies about the banana being yellow.
3. **Janiyah** claims Madison lies. However, **Philomena** says Janiyah lies. There's no testimony against Philomena, so we believe her. Therefore, Janiyah lies, meaning Madison tells the truth, reinforcing that Melina lies.
4. **Braelyn** also claims Melina lies. **Hannah** says Braelyn lies. But **Jordan** claims Hannah lies, and there's no testimony against Jordan, so we believe him. Thus, Hannah lies, and Braelyn tells the truth, further confirming that Melina lies.
5. **Merrin** claims Melina lies. **Zinnia** says Merrin lies. **Layna** claims Zinnia lies, but **Tori** says Layna lies. Tori is unchallenged, so we believe her.

   - Since no one says **Rowan** might lie, we believe **Rowan**.
   - Therefore, **Ryan** **lies** when he says **Taliah lies**.
4. **Jessamy** claims that **Daniel lies**.
   - Since no one says **Jessamy** might lie, we believe **Jessamy**.
   - Therefore, **Daniel** **lies** when he says **Taliah lies**.

#### Witnesses Claiming **Dominic** Lies:

- **Ian** claims that **Dominic lies**.
  - However, **Zana** claims that **Ian lies**.
    - Since no one says **Zana** might lie, we believe **Zana**.
    - Therefore, **Ian** **lies** when he says **Dominic lies**.
    - This means **Dominic** tells the **truth** when he says **Taliah lies**.

### Step 3: Reconcile the Contradiction

We have a contradiction here:

- Four witnesses (**Kaydence**, **Callista**, **Ryan**, **Daniel**) who say **Taliah lies** are themselves lying, so **Taliah tells the truth**.
- One witness (**Dominic**) who says **Taliah lies** is telling the **truth**, so **Taliah lies**.

This contradiction implies that our assumptions lead to an inconsistency unless we reconsider.

### Step 4: Re-Evaluate Our Assumptions

Given that **Dominic** tells the **truth** (as established through **Zana's** testimony), and he says **Taliah lies**, we must accept that **Taliah lies**.

Now, let's revisit the other witnesses:

- If **Taliah lies** (the blanket is **not soft**), then the witnesses who claim she lies (**Kaydence**, **Callista**, **Ryan**, **Daniel**, **Dominic**) are telling the **truth**.
- The witnesses who claim these witnesses lie (**Alani**, **Cassius**, **Rowan**, **Jessamy**) must themselves be **lying**.
- Since no one says that **Alani**, **Cassius**, **Rowan**, or **Jessamy** might lie, this seems contradictory.

However, the key lies in accepting that if our initial assumption leads to a contradiction, we must accept the only consistent scenario:

- **Taliah lies** (the blanket is **not soft**).
- Witnesses saying **Taliah lies** (**Kaydence**, **Callista**, **Ryan**, **Daniel**, **Dominic**) tell the **truth**.
- Witnesses who say these witnesses lie (**Alani**, **Cassius**, **Rowan**, **Jessamy**, **Ian**) are **lying**.
- **Zana** said **Ian** lies, reinforcing that **Ian** is lying (consistent with our conclusion).

### Step 5: Conclusion

Since the only consistent scenario is that **Taliah lies** about the blanket being soft, the blanket is **not soft**.

Witness Raina claims that witness Christian lies.
Witness Mia claims that witness Layne lies.

Witness Eva claims that witness Audrey lies.
Witness Renata claims that witness Eva lies.
Witness Tessa claims that witness Renata lies.
Witness Mallory claims that witness Tessa lies.
Witness Ayla claims that witness Mallory lies.
Question: is the store open?
End your answer with: ""Answer: yes or no""","To solve this puzzle, we need to determine whether the store is open based on the witnesses' statements and the rule that witnesses should be believed unless there is testimony that they might lie.

Let's consider the witnesses:

1. **Layne** says the store is open.
2. **Chloe** says that Layne lies.
3. **Keren** says that Chloe lies.
4. **Christian** says that Keren lies.
5. **Raina** says that Christian lies.
6. **Mia** says that Layne lies.
7. **Audrey** says that Mia lies.
8. **Eva** says that Audrey lies.
9. **Renata** says that Eva lies.
10. **Tessa** says that Renata lies.
11. **Mallory** says that Tessa lies.
12. **Ayla** says that Mallory lies.

Witnesses with **no testimony against them** are **Raina** and **Ayla**, so we must believe them.

- **Raina** says that **Christian** lies. Therefore, **Christian** is lying.
- **Christian** (who is lying) says that **Keren** lies. Since he's lying, **Keren** is telling the truth.
- **Keren** says that **Chloe** lies. Therefore, **Chloe** is lying.
- **Chloe** (who is lying) says that **Layne** lies. Since she's lying, **Layne** is telling the truth.
- **Layne** says the store is open. So, the store is open according to this chain.

Now, from **Ayla**:

- **Ayla** says that **Mallory** lies. Therefore, **Mallory** is lying.
- **Mallory** (who is lying) says that **Tessa** lies. Since she's lying, **Tessa** is telling the truth.
- **Tessa** says that **Renata** lies. Therefore, **Renata** is lying.
- **Renata** (who is lying) says that **Eva** lies. Since she's lying, **Eva** is telling the truth.
- **Eva** says that **Audrey** lies. Therefore, **Audrey** is lying.
- **Audrey** (who is lying) says that **Mia** lies. Since she's lying, **Mia** is telling the truth.
- **Mia** says that **Layne** lies. Therefore, **Layne** is lying.

This creates a contradiction: **Layne** cannot both be telling the truth and lying. Since our assumption that all witnesses without testimony against them are telling the truth leads to a contradiction, we need to resolve it.

Given that **Raina** and **Ayla** cannot both be telling the truth (as it leads to inconsistency), but there's no testimony against either of them, the only logical conclusion is that the store is **not** open.

End your answer with: ""Answer: yes or no""","To solve this puzzle, we'll analyze the statements and determine which witnesses are telling the truth or lying based on the given rule:

**Witnesses should be believed unless there is testimony that they might lie.**

Let's list the witnesses and their statements:

1. **Camryn** says that **the door is locked**.
2. **Elowen** claims that **Camryn lies**.
3. **Sadira** claims that **Elowen lies**.
4. **Xanthe** claims that **Camryn lies**.

11. **Skylar** claims that **Abigail lies**.
12. **Hannah** claims that **Skylar lies**.
13. **Skya** claims that **Hannah lies**.

Now, we'll determine the truthfulness of each witness by analyzing the chain of testimonies:

- **Camryn** states the door is locked. She should be believed unless there's testimony that she might lie.
  - **Elowen** says **Camryn lies**, casting doubt on Camryn.
    - **Sadira** says **Elowen lies**, which suggests Elowen might be lying.
      - No one says **Sadira lies**, so we believe Sadira.
      - Therefore, **Elowen is lying** when she says Camryn lies.

- **Xanthe** also says **Camryn lies**.
  - **Anthony** says **Xanthe lies**, suggesting Xanthe might be lying.
    - **Anna** says **Anthony lies**, casting doubt on Anthony.
      - **Kaylee** says **Anna lies**, indicating Anna might be lying.
        - **Saia** says **Kaylee lies**, casting doubt on Kaylee.
          - **Alessia** says **Saia lies**, suggesting Saia might be lying.
            - **Abigail** says **Alessia lies**, casting doubt on Alessia.
              - **Skylar** says **Abigail lies**, suggesting Abigail might be lying.
                - **Hannah** says **Skylar lies**, casting doubt on Skylar.
                  - **Skya** says **Hannah lies**.
                    - No one says **Skya lies**, so we believe Skya.
                    - Therefore, **Hannah is lying** when she says Skylar lies.
                  - Since Hannah lies, **Skylar tells the truth** that Abigail lies.
                - Since Abigail lies, **Alessia tells the truth** that Saia lies.
              - Since Saia lies, **Kaylee tells the truth** that Anna lies.
            - Since Anna lies, **Anthony tells the truth** that Xanthe lies.
          - Since Xanthe lies, her claim that Camryn lies is false.
  
Since both **Elowen and Xanthe are lying** when they say Camryn lies, there's no valid testimony against Camryn's statement.

**Conclusion:** Camryn is telling the truth when she says the door is locked.

Here’s the step-by-step analysis:

1. **Yara** says the movie is good.

2. **Ella** claims that **Yara** lies.
   - Ella is now casting doubt on Yara's truthfulness.

3. **Brooks** claims that **Ella** lies.
   - Since no one accuses Brooks of lying, we believe Brooks.
   - Therefore, Ella lies about Yara.
   - This means Yara tells the truth.

4. **Aubrey** claims that **Yara** lies.
   - **Orion** claims that **Aubrey** lies.
     - Orion is believed (no testimony against Orion).
     - Thus, Aubrey lies about Yara.
     - Yara continues to be truthful.

5. **Kaiya** claims that **Yara** lies.
   - **Gracie** claims that **Kaiya** lies.
     - Gracie is believed.
     - Therefore, Kaiya lies about Yara.
     - Yara remains truthful.

6. **Jada** claims that **Gracie** lies.
   - **Aviana** claims that **Jada** lies.
     - Aviana is believed.

8. **Keira** claims that **Jordan** lies.
   - **Octavia** claims that **Keira** lies.
     - Octavia is believed.
     - Therefore, Keira lies about Jordan.

Now, assess each witness:

- **Vale**, **Felicity**, **Kayleigh**, **Alia**, and **Isha** are not accused of lying by anyone. Therefore, we believe them.
- By believing **Vale**, **Felicity**, and **Kayleigh**, we conclude that **Devyn**, **Eli**, and **Micah** are lying when they say Hattie lies. This supports that Hattie could be telling the truth.
- **Alia** says **Kallie** lies. Since Alia is unchallenged, we accept that Kallie lies. Therefore, Kallie's accusation that Juniper lies is false, meaning **Juniper** is telling the truth when she says Hattie lies.
- Similarly, **Isha** says **Noemi** lies. Accepting this, **Noemi** is lying about **Jamiya** lying. Therefore, **Jamiya** is truthful when saying Hattie lies.

Since **Juniper** and **Jamiya** are unchallenged credible witnesses who allege that Hattie lies, and there is no unchallenged testimony against them, we accept that Hattie is lying.

**1. Samantha says the phone is ringing.**

**2. Adley claims that Samantha lies.**

**However:**

**3. Sabel claims that Samantha lies.**

- **Skye claims that Sabel lies.**
- **Ezra claims that Skye lies.** No one says Ezra lies, so we believe him.

1. **Kai says the ocean is deep.** We can believe Kai unless there's evidence he lies.

2. **Gracie claims Kai lies.** This suggests Kai might be lying.

3. **Callista claims Gracie lies.** There is no testimony against Callista, so we believe her. Therefore, Gracie lies, and her claim that Kai lies is false. This supports that Kai tells the truth.

4. **Skya claims Kai lies.** This again suggests Kai might be lying.

5. **Zuna claims Skya lies.** 

6. **Selah claims Zuna lies.**

7. **Isabella claims Selah lies.**

8. **Briar claims Isabella lies.** There is no testimony against Briar, so we believe her. Therefore, Isabella lies, making Selah truthful. 

   - **Selah (truthful) says Zuna lies.**
   - Since Zuna lies, her claim that Skya lies is false, so Skya tells the truth.

   - **Skya (truthful) says Kai lies.** This contradicts our earlier support for Kai.

9. **Genesis claims Kai lies.** This is additional testimony that Kai might be lying.

10. **Micah claims Genesis lies.**

11. **Maverick claims Micah lies.**

12. **Liana claims Maverick lies.**

13. **Felicity claims Liana lies.** There is no testimony against Felicity, so we believe her. Therefore, Liana lies, making Maverick truthful.

Question: are the stars shining?
End your answer with: ""Answer: yes or no""","To determine whether the stars are shining, we need to assess the credibility of the witnesses based on the given rule:

**Rule**: *Witnesses should be believed unless there is testimony that they might lie.*

Let's analyze the statements step by step.

1. **Camryn** says that the stars are shining.
2. **Aubree** claims that Camryn lies.
   - Unless discredited, Aubree is telling the truth, so Camryn is lying.
3. **Kayleigh** claims that Aubree lies.
   - Unless discredited, Kayleigh is telling the truth, discrediting Aubree.
   - This would mean Aubree is lying, so Camryn is telling the truth.
4. **Daisy** claims that Kayleigh lies.
   - Unless discredited, Daisy is telling the truth, discrediting Kayleigh.
   - Therefore, Kayleigh is lying, so Aubree is telling the truth, and Camryn is lying.

So, based on the first set of testimonies, Camryn is lying about the stars shining.

Next, consider the second set:

5. **Adley** claims that Camryn lies.
   - Unless discredited, Adley is telling the truth, so Camryn is lying.
6. **Juliet** claims that Adley lies.
   - Unless discredited, Juliet is telling the truth, discrediting Adley.
   - This would mean Adley is lying, so Camryn is telling the truth.
7. **Zaniyah** claims that Juliet lies.
   - Unless discredited, Zaniyah is telling the truth, discrediting Juliet.
   - Therefore, Juliet is lying, so Adley is telling the truth, and Camryn is lying.

Again, Camryn is concluded to be lying.

Finally, the third set:

8. **Starla** claims that Camryn lies.
   - Unless discredited, Starla is telling the truth, so Camryn is lying.
9. **Amari** claims that Starla lies.
   - Unless discredited, Amari is telling the truth, discrediting Starla.
   - This would mean Starla is lying, so Camryn is telling the truth.
10. **Jolene** claims that Amari lies.
    - Unless discredited, Jolene is telling the truth, discrediting Amari.
    - Therefore, Amari is lying, so Starla is telling the truth, and Camryn is lying.
11. **Olivia** claims that Jolene lies.
    - Unless discredited, Olivia is telling the truth, discrediting Jolene.
    - This means Jolene is lying, so Amari is telling the truth, discrediting Starla.
12. **Kieran** claims that Olivia lies.
    - Unless discredited, Kieran is telling the truth, discrediting Olivia.
    - Therefore, Olivia is lying, so Jolene is telling the truth, discrediting Amari.
13. **Adalyn** claims that Kieran lies.
    - Unless discredited, Adalyn is telling the truth, discrediting Kieran.
    - This means Kieran is lying, so Olivia is telling the truth, discrediting Jolene.

After this complex chain, we find that Olivia is telling the truth, leading back to the conclusion that Camryn is telling the truth.

**Conclusion**:

- The first two sets of testimonies consistently conclude that Camryn is lying.
- The third set contains contradictory testimonies that ultimately do not outweigh the consistent conclusion from the first two sets.

Based on the majority and consistency of the testimonies, it is reasonable to conclude that Camryn is lying about the stars shining.

1. **Witness Brooks** says the tree is tall.
   - **Is there testimony that Brooks might lie?**
     - **Witness Jolene** says that Brooks lies.
       - **Is there testimony that Jolene might lie?**
         - **Witness Salvador** says that Jolene lies.
           - **Is there testimony that Salvador might lie?**
             - **Witness Keren** says that Salvador lies.
               - **Is there testimony that Keren might lie?**
                 - **Witness Olivia** says that Keren lies.
                   - **Is there testimony that Olivia might lie?**
                     - **Witness Zoe** says that Olivia lies.
                       - **Is there testimony that Zoe might lie?**
                         - **No testimony against Zoe.** Therefore, we **believe Zoe**.
                   - Since Zoe says Olivia lies, **we cannot believe Olivia**.
               - With Olivia's testimony invalid, there is **no acceptable testimony against Keren**. So, **we believe Keren**.
           - Since Keren says Salvador lies, **we cannot believe Salvador**.
       - With Salvador's testimony invalid, there is **no acceptable testimony against Jolene**. So, **we believe Jolene**.
   - Since Jolene says Brooks lies, **we cannot believe Brooks**.

2. **Additional Testimony Against Brooks**:
   - **Witness Parker** says that Brooks lies.
     - **Is there testimony that Parker might lie?**
       - **Witness Mary** says that Parker lies.

                           - **Witness Jenna** says that Zaylee lies.
                             - **No testimony against Jenna.** Therefore, we **believe Jenna**.
                         - Since Jenna says Zaylee lies, **we cannot believe Zaylee**.
                     - With Zaylee's testimony invalid, there is **no acceptable testimony against Josie**. So, **we believe Josie**.
                 - Since Josie says Caleb lies, **we cannot believe Caleb**.
             - With Caleb's testimony invalid, there is **no acceptable testimony against Caitlyn**. So, **we believe Caitlyn**.
         - Since Caitlyn says Mary lies, **we cannot believe Mary**.
     - With Mary's testimony invalid, there is **no acceptable testimony against Parker**. So, **we believe Parker**.
   - Since Parker says Brooks lies, **we cannot believe Brooks**.

**Conclusion**: There is credible testimony from both Jolene and Parker that Brooks lies, and no acceptable evidence to discredit their statements. Therefore, we cannot believe Brooks when he says the tree is tall.

12. **Gianna** claims that **Adrian lies**.
13. **Raegan** claims that **Gianna lies**.

According to the puzzle's rule, **""Witnesses should be believed unless there is testimony that they might lie.""**

**First Chain (Witnesses 1-7):**

- **Nia** is not accused of lying by anyone. So, we **believe Nia** when she says **Penelope lies**.
- Since **Penelope lies**, her claim that **Melanie lies** is false, so **Melanie tells the truth**.
- **Melanie** says **Xanthe lies**, so **Xanthe** is lying.
- Because **Xanthe lies**, her claim that **Brinley lies** is false, so **Brinley tells the truth**.
- **Brinley** says **Daniel lies**, so **Daniel** is lying.
- Since **Daniel lies**, his claim that **Kallie lies** is false, so **Kallie tells the truth**.

**Second Chain (Witnesses 8-13):**

- **Raegan** is not accused of lying by anyone. So, we **believe Raegan** when she says **Gianna lies**.
- Since **Gianna lies**, her claim that **Adrian lies** is false, so **Adrian tells the truth**.
- **Adrian** says **Zaylee lies**, so **Zaylee** is lying.
- Because **Zaylee lies**, her claim that **Zinnia lies** is false, so **Zinnia tells the truth**.
- **Zinnia** says **Nova lies**, so **Nova** is lying.
- Since **Nova lies**, her claim that **Kallie lies** is false, so **Kallie tells the truth**.

**Conclusion:**

Both chains confirm that **Kallie tells the truth** when she says **""The house is big.""**

End your answer with: ""Answer: yes or no""","To solve this reasoning puzzle, we'll follow the chain of testimonies and determine who is lying and who is telling the truth, based on the rule: Witnesses should be believed unless there is testimony that they might lie.

1. **Easton says the baby is sleeping.**

2. **Jayce claims that Easton lies.** This is a testimony against Easton, so we now have reason to believe Easton might be lying.

3. **Aniyah claims that Jayce lies.** This is a testimony against Jayce.

4. **Alia claims that Aniyah lies.** This is a testimony against Aniyah.

5. **Isla claims that Alia lies.** This is a testimony against Alia.

6. **Selah claims that Isla lies.** This is a testimony against Isla.

7. **Lucy claims that Selah lies.** This is a testimony against Selah.

8. **Kyla claims that Lucy lies.** This is a testimony against Lucy.

13. **Odalys claims that Christian lies.** This is a testimony against Christian.

14. **Livia claims that Odalys lies.** This is a testimony against Odalys.

**Now, Livia is the last witness, and there's no testimony against her. Therefore, we believe Livia is telling the truth.**

- **Livia says Odalys lies.** So Odalys is lying.
- Since **Odalys lies when claiming Christian lies**, Christian is telling the truth.
- **Christian says Kaylani lies.** So Kaylani is lying.
- **Kaylani lies when claiming Ian lies**, so Ian is telling the truth.
- **Ian says Santiago lies.** So Santiago is lying.
- **Santiago lies when claiming Kyla lies**, so Kyla is telling the truth.
- **Kyla says Lucy lies.** So Lucy is lying.
- **Lucy lies when claiming Selah lies**, so Selah is telling the truth.
- **Selah says Isla lies.** So Isla is lying.
- **Isla lies when claiming Alia lies**, so Alia is telling the truth.
- **Alia says Aniyah lies.** So Aniyah is lying.
- **Aniyah lies when claiming Jayce lies**, so Jayce is telling the truth.
- **Jayce says Easton lies.** So Easton is lying.
- **Easton lies when saying the baby is sleeping.**

**Conclusion:** Easton is lying about the baby sleeping.

Question: is the coffee cold?
End your answer with: ""Answer: yes or no""","To determine whether the coffee is cold, let's analyze the witness testimonies based on the rule that witnesses should be believed unless there is testimony that they might lie.

1. **Zuna** says the coffee is cold.
2. **Tahlia** through **Vesper** (9 witnesses) claim that Zuna lies.
3. **Amelia** also claims that Zuna lies.
4. **Xanthe** says that Amelia lies.
5. **Lyric** says that Xanthe lies.
6. **Angela** says that Lyric lies.

Let's break it down:

- **Zuna**'s credibility is challenged by **Tahlia** through **Vesper**, who have no testimonies against them suggesting they might lie. Therefore, their claims stand, and Zuna might be lying.
  
- **Amelia**'s credibility is questioned by **Xanthe**. However:
  - **Xanthe** is accused of lying by **Lyric**.
  - **Lyric** is accused of lying by **Angela**.
  - Since no one accuses **Angela** of lying, **Angela** is credible, making **Lyric** possibly lying.
  - If **Lyric** might be lying, we can't trust her claim that **Xanthe** lies. Therefore, **Xanthe** is credible, so **Amelia** might be lying.

Even if we dismiss **Amelia**'s testimony, we still have 9 credible witnesses (**Tahlia** through **Vesper**) claiming that **Zuna** lies. Since there's no testimony against these 9 witnesses, **Zuna** might be lying, and we cannot trust her claim that the coffee is cold.

**Conclusion:** Based on the credible testimonies, the coffee is not cold.

Question: is the wind strong?
End your answer with: ""Answer: yes or no""","To solve this reasoning puzzle, let's carefully analyze the statements and apply the provided rule: _Witnesses should be believed unless there is testimony that they might lie._

1. **Astrid** says the wind is strong.

2. **Nina** claims that Astrid lies.
   - Since Nina accuses Astrid, we have reason to doubt Astrid.
   
3. **Miles** claims that Nina lies.
   - No one accuses Miles of lying, so we believe Miles.
   - Therefore, Nina is lying about Astrid.
   - This suggests Astrid might be telling the truth.

4. **Lennon** claims that Astrid lies.
   - **Ellie** claims that Lennon lies.
   - No one accuses Ellie of lying, so we believe Ellie.
   - Therefore, Lennon is lying, and Astrid might be telling the truth.

5. **Aubree** claims that Astrid lies.
   - **Azaria** claims that Aubree lies.
   - **Aracely** claims that Azaria lies.
   - **Lincoln** claims that Aracely lies.
   - **Lillian** claims that Lincoln lies.
   - **Marigold** claims that Lillian lies.
   - **Alia** claims that Marigold lies.
   - **Theo** claims that Alia lies.
   - **Amayah** claims that Theo lies.
   - No one accuses Amayah of lying, so we believe Amayah.
   - Therefore, Theo is lying, so Alia tells the truth.
   - This chain leads to the conclusion that Aubree tells the truth.
   - Since Aubree claims that Astrid lies, this suggests Astrid is lying.

We have two conflicting conclusions about Astrid: one suggests she's telling the truth, and the other suggests she's lying. However, the chain of testimonies through Aubree and Amayah is longer and involves more unchallenged witnesses, which strengthens the conclusion that Astrid is lying.

Therefore, the consistent logical conclusion based on the testimonies is that **Astrid is lying**, so the wind is **not** strong.

Witness Liora claims that witness Kai lies.
Witness Thomas claims that witness Liora lies.
Witness Quincy claims that witness Thomas lies.
Question: is the book heavy?
End your answer with: ""Answer: yes or no""","To solve this puzzle, we need to determine whether the book is heavy based on the testimonies of the witnesses, following the rule: ""Witnesses should be believed unless there is testimony that they might lie.""

Here's a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Lyric says the book is heavy.** We will believe Lyric unless there is credible testimony that Lyric might lie.

2. **David claims that Lyric lies.** This suggests Lyric might be lying. However, David's credibility needs to be assessed.

3. **Kyla claims that David lies.** Since no one accuses Kyla of lying, we believe Kyla. Therefore, David is lying when he says Lyric lies, which supports that Lyric is telling the truth.

4. **Stormy claims that Lyric lies.** Malia claims that Stormy lies, and since Malia is unimpugned, we believe her. Thus, Stormy is lying, further supporting that Lyric is telling the truth.

5. **Annika claims that Lyric lies.** Phoenix claims that Annika lies. Phoenix is unimpugned, so we accept that Annika is lying, again supporting Lyric's truthfulness.

6. **Santiago claims that Lyric lies.** Fiera claims that Santiago lies. Fiera is unimpugned, so Santiago is lying, reinforcing that Lyric is telling the truth.

7. **Maxine claims that Lyric lies.** Kai claims that Maxine lies. Liora claims that Kai lies. Thomas claims that Liora lies. Quincy claims that Thomas lies. Quincy is unimpugned, so Thomas is lying, which means Liora is telling the truth, indicating that Kai is lying, which suggests Maxine is telling the truth. This implies Lyric is lying.

At this point, we encounter a contradiction. The earlier unimpugned witnesses (Kyla, Malia, Phoenix, Fiera) support that Lyric is telling the truth, while the last chain suggests Lyric is lying.

Given the rule that witnesses should be believed unless there is testimony that they might lie, and since Quincy is the only unimpugned witness in the last chain, but his statement leads to a contradiction with multiple other unimpugned witnesses, we must resolve the contradiction in favor of the majority of unimpugned testimonies.

Therefore, the evidence supports that Lyric is telling the truth, and the book is heavy.

Here's the breakdown:

1. **Witnesses Claiming Soraya Lies:**
   - **Jenna** claims that Soraya lies.
   - No reliable witness testifies that Jenna might lie; Millie accuses Jenna, but Millie is testified against by Imani, making Millie unreliable.
   - Therefore, Jenna is a reliable witness who says Soraya lies.

Question: is the pasta ready?
End your answer with: ""Answer: yes or no""","To determine whether the pasta is ready, we need to evaluate the testimonies of the witnesses, believing each one unless there is evidence that they might lie.

1. **Brooks** says the pasta is ready.
2. **Callan** claims Brooks lies. 
    - **Anwen** claims Callan lies. No one says Anwen lies, so we believe Anwen, meaning Callan lies. Therefore, Callan's claim that Brooks lies is false.
3. **Leoni** claims Brooks lies.
    - **Ramiro** claims Leoni lies.
        - **Isha** claims Ramiro lies. No one says Isha lies, so we believe Isha, meaning Ramiro lies. Thus, Leoni does not lie, and her claim that Brooks lies is true.
4. **Freya** claims Brooks lies.
    - **Isla** claims Freya lies.
        - **Emmeline** claims Isla lies. No one says Emmeline lies, so we believe Emmeline, meaning Isla lies. Thus, Freya does not lie, and her claim that Brooks lies is true.
5. **Jessamy** claims Brooks lies.
    - **Noa** claims Jessamy lies.
        - **Nikolas** claims Noa lies.
            - **Kyra** claims Nikolas lies.
                - **Alexander** claims Kyra lies. No one says Alexander lies, so we believe Alexander, meaning Kyra lies. Thus, Nikolas does not lie, so Noa lies, meaning Jessamy does not lie, and her claim that Brooks lies is true.

Since **Leoni**, **Freya**, and **Jessamy** truthfully claim that Brooks lies, we conclude that **Brooks lies** about the pasta being ready.

Question: is the music loud?
End your answer with: ""Answer: yes or no""","To solve this reasoning puzzle, we need to determine whether the music is loud based on the witnesses' statements and the given rule: witnesses should be believed unless there is testimony that they might lie.

**Summary of Witness Statements:**

1. **Jayden** says the music is loud.
2. **Victoria** claims that Jayden lies.
3. **Elle** claims that Victoria lies.
4. **Elsie** claims that Jayden lies.
5. **Philomena** claims that Elsie lies.
6. **Jaxson** claims that Philomena lies.
7. **Reyna** claims that Jaxson lies.
8. **Ian** claims that Jayden lies.
9. **Monroe** claims that Ian lies.
10. **Lennon** claims that Monroe lies.
11. **Addison** claims that Lennon lies.
12. **Aracely** claims that Addison lies.
13. **Taylor** claims that Aracely lies.
14. **Jett** claims that Taylor lies.

**Logical Analysis:**

1. **Assume Jayden tells the truth** (the music is loud).
   - Jayden's statement is true.
   - **Victoria** says Jayden lies. Since **Elle** says Victoria lies, and no one says Elle lies, **Elle** is telling the truth, so **Victoria** is lying.
   - **Elsie** says Jayden lies. **Philomena** says Elsie lies. **Jaxson** says Philomena lies. **Reyna** says Jaxson lies. No one says Reyna lies, so Reyna tells the truth, meaning Jaxson lies. Thus, Philomena tells the truth, so Elsie lies.
   - **Ian** says Jayden lies. **Monroe** says Ian lies. **Lennon** says Monroe lies. **Addison** says Lennon lies. **Aracely** says Addison lies. **Taylor** says Aracely lies. **Jett** says Taylor lies. No one says Jett lies, so Jett tells the truth, meaning Taylor lies. Therefore, Aracely tells the truth, so Addison lies. Lennon tells the truth, so Monroe lies, and Ian lies.
   - **In this scenario, only one person (Jett) is lying without testimony against them.**

2. **Assume Jayden lies** (the music is not loud).
   - Jayden's statement is false.
   - **Victoria** says Jayden lies. Since Jayden is lying, Victoria tells the truth.
   - **Elle** says Victoria lies. No one says Elle lies, but if Victoria tells the truth, then Elle must be lying.
   - **Reyna** claims that Jaxson lies. If we follow the chain under this assumption, **Reyna** must be lying. No one says Reyna lies.
   - **In this scenario, two people (Elle and Reyna) are lying without testimony against them.**

**Conclusion:**

Following the rule that witnesses are believed unless there's testimony they might lie, and aiming to minimize the number of witnesses who are lying without being accused, the first scenario is more consistent.

Witness Isaiah claims that witness Anaya lies.
Witness Elara claims that witness Isaiah lies.
Witness Nina claims that witness Elara lies.
Question: is the plane landing?
End your answer with: ""Answer: yes or no""","To solve this reasoning puzzle, we need to determine whether the plane is landing based on the testimonies of the witnesses, who should be believed unless there is testimony that they might lie.

First, let's note the witnesses who have no testimony against them:

- **Parker**: No one says Parker lies.
- **Nikolas**: No one says Nikolas lies.
- **Nina**: No one says Nina lies.

According to the rules, we consider Parker, Nikolas, and Nina to be telling the truth.

Now, let's analyze the statements starting with Parker:

1. **Parker** says **Kaliyah** lies.
   - Since Parker tells the truth, **Kaliyah** is lying.
2. **Kaliyah** says **Lillian** lies.
   - Since Kaliyah is lying, her statement is false; therefore, **Lillian** tells the truth.

Next, analyze the chain starting with Nina:

1. **Nina** says **Elara** lies.
   - Since Nina tells the truth, **Elara** is lying.
2. **Elara** says **Isaiah** lies.
   - Since Elara is lying, her statement is false; therefore, **Isaiah** tells the truth.
3. **Isaiah** says **Anaya** lies.
   - Since Isaiah tells the truth, **Anaya** is lying.
4. **Anaya** says **Zafira** lies.
   - Since Anaya is lying, her statement is false; therefore, **Zafira** tells the truth.
5. **Zafira** says **Holly** lies.
   - Since Zafira tells the truth, **Holly** is lying.
6. **Holly** says **Lillian** lies.
   - Since Holly is lying, her statement is false; therefore, **Lillian** tells the truth.

So, from both chains, we conclude that **Lillian** tells the truth when she says, ""The plane is landing.""

Therefore, the plane is landing.

**Witnesses should be believed unless there is testimony that they might lie.**

1. **Christian** says: *The weather is nice*.
   
   - **Is there testimony that Christian might lie?** 
     - Yes. **Skylar** claims that Christian lies.

2. **Skylar** says: *Christian lies*.
   
   - **Is there testimony that Skylar might lie?**
     - Yes. **Saphira** claims that Skylar lies.

3. **Saphira** says: *Skylar lies*.

     - Yes. **Kayleigh** claims that Saphira lies.

4. **Kayleigh** says: *Saphira lies*.
   
   - **Is there testimony that Kayleigh might lie?**
     - **No**. No one claims that Kayleigh lies.

**Conclusion from this chain:**

- Since Kayleigh is unchallenged, we believe her statement that Saphira lies.
- Therefore, Saphira lies about Skylar lying.
- This means **Skylar tells the truth** when she says Christian lies.
- Therefore, **Christian lies** about the weather being nice.

      - Yes. **Alaina** claims that Eithne lies.

14. **Alaina** says: *Eithne lies*.
    
    - **Is there testimony that Alaina might lie?**
      - **No**. No one claims that Alaina lies.

**Conclusion from this chain:**

- Since Alaina is unchallenged, we believe her statement that Eithne lies.
- Tracing back:
  - Eithne lies ⇒ Reagan tells the truth.
  - Reagan tells the truth ⇒ Lily lies.
  - Lily lies ⇒ Mariah tells the truth.
  - Mariah tells the truth ⇒ Jessamy lies.
  - Jessamy lies ⇒ Selah tells the truth.
  - Selah tells the truth ⇒ Maelyn lies.
  - Maelyn lies ⇒ Monroe tells the truth.
  - Monroe tells the truth ⇒ Calista lies.
  - Calista lies ⇒ Christian tells the truth.

- **Therefore, Christian tells the truth** about the weather being nice.

**Conflict:**

- From the first chain, Christian lies.
- From the second chain, Christian tells the truth.

**Resolution:**

Given that we have unchallenged witnesses (Kayleigh and Alaina) leading to contradictory conclusions, the puzzle reaches an inconsistency. However, since Kayleigh's chain is shorter and requires fewer assumptions, and the initial instruction emphasizes believing witnesses unless there's testimony against them, we prioritize the evidence from Kayleigh's chain.

Question: is the book heavy?
End your answer with: ""Answer: yes or no""","To determine if the book is heavy, we'll analyze the witnesses based on the provided rules:

**Rule:** Witnesses should be believed unless there is testimony that they might lie.

Let's break down the testimonies:

1. **Elara** says that the book is heavy.
2. **Jenna** claims that Elara lies.
   - No one (reliably) claims that Jenna lies except Indigo.
3. **Indigo** claims that Jenna lies.
   - **Ava** claims that Indigo lies.
   - No one claims that Ava lies.
   - Therefore, Ava is trustworthy, and Indigo is lying.
   - So, Jenna is telling the truth.
4. Since **Jenna** is telling the truth when she says **Elara** lies, we cannot trust Elara.
5. **Mason** also claims that Elara lies.
   - **Jack** claims that Mason lies.
   - **Julian** claims that Jack lies.
   - No one claims that Julian lies.
   - Therefore, Julian is trustworthy, Jack is lying, and Mason is telling the truth.
6. **Mason** is trustworthy when he says **Elara** lies.
7. **Rhiannon** claims that Elara lies.
   - **Kassidy** claims that Rhiannon lies.
   - **Brooks** claims that Kassidy lies.
   - No one claims that Brooks lies.
   - Therefore, Brooks is trustworthy, Kassidy is lying, and Rhiannon is telling the truth.
8. **Rhiannon** is trustworthy when she says **Elara** lies.
9. **Kyra** claims that Elara lies.
   - **Leila** claims that Kyra lies.
   - **Grace** claims that Leila lies.
   - **Teagan** claims that Grace lies.
   - No one claims that Teagan lies.
   - Therefore, Teagan is trustworthy, Grace is lying, Leila is telling the truth, and Kyra lies.
10. Since **Kyra** lies about Elara, this doesn't affect the earlier conclusions.

**Conclusion:**
- **Elara** is accused of lying by trustworthy witnesses (**Jenna**, **Mason**, **Rhiannon**).
- According to the rule, we cannot believe Elara's statement.
- Since there's no trustworthy witness confirming that the book is heavy, and Elara's statement is unreliable, we conclude that the book is not heavy.

Witness Kendra claims that witness Renata lies.
Witness Beckham claims that witness Kendra lies.
Witness Mira claims that witness Beckham lies.
Witness Eva claims that witness Mira lies.
Question: is the room clean?
End your answer with: ""Answer: yes or no""","To solve this reasoning puzzle, we need to determine whether the room is clean based on the witnesses' statements, considering that witnesses should be believed unless there is testimony that they might lie.

First, identify the witnesses who have no testimony against them—they are Maverick, Jenna, and Eva. According to the rules, we can believe them.

- **Maverick** says that **Eliana** lies.
- **Jenna** says that **Hudson** lies.
- **Eva** says that **Mira** lies.

Since Maverick, Jenna, and Eva have no testimony against them, their statements are true. Therefore:

- **Eliana** is lying.
- **Hudson** is lying.
- **Mira** is lying.

Now, let's consider the implications:

1. **Eliana** lies when she says that **Winslow** lies. Therefore, **Winslow** is telling the truth.
2. **Winslow** says that **Annabelle** lies, so **Annabelle** is lying.
3. **Annabelle** lies when she says that **Rina** lies. This suggests that **Rina** is telling the truth. 

However, from another chain:

1. **Mira** lies when she says that **Beckham** lies. Therefore, **Beckham** is telling the truth.
2. **Beckham** says that **Kendra** lies, so **Kendra** is lying.
3. **Kendra** lies when she says that **Renata** lies. Therefore, **Renata** is telling the truth.
4. **Renata** says that **Rina** lies, so **Rina** is lying.

Now we have a contradiction: **Rina** is both telling the truth and lying. This inconsistency means we cannot definitively conclude whether **Rina** is truthful.

Since **Rina** is the only witness stating that the room is clean and there is contradictory testimony about her honesty, we cannot accept her claim. Therefore, based on the available information and the rule that we should believe witnesses unless they might lie (and Rina might lie), we conclude that the room is not clean.

2. **Collins** says **John** lies.
3. **Rowan** says **Collins** lies.
4. **Jenna** says **Rowan** lies.
5. **Jackson** says **Jenna** lies.
6. **Audrey** says **Jackson** lies.
7. **Avery** says **Audrey** lies.

No one claims that **Avery** might lie, so we believe **Avery**. Therefore, **Audrey** lies.

- Since **Audrey** lies about **Jackson** lying, **Jackson** tells the truth.
- **Jackson** says **Jenna** lies, so **Jenna** lies.
- As **Jenna** lies about **Rowan** lying, **Rowan** tells the truth.
- **Rowan** says **Collins** lies, so **Collins** lies.
- Since **Collins** lies about **John** lying, **John** tells the truth.

**Second Chain:**

1. **Anthony** says **John** lies.
2. **Rina** says **Anthony** lies.
3. **Logan** says **Rina** lies.
4. **Remi** says **Logan** lies.
5. **Kayleigh** says **Remi** lies.
6. **Ayla** says **Kayleigh** lies.
7. **Jeremiah** says **Ayla** lies.

No one claims that **Jeremiah** might lie, so we believe **Jeremiah**. Therefore, **Ayla** lies.

- Since **Ayla** lies about **Kayleigh** lying, **Kayleigh** tells the truth.
- **Kayleigh** says **Remi** lies, so **Remi** lies.
- **Remi** lies about **Logan** lying, so **Logan** tells the truth.
- **Logan** says **Rina** lies, so **Rina** lies.
- Since **Rina** lies about **Anthony** lying, **Anthony** tells the truth.
- **Anthony** says **John** lies, so **John** lies.

We have a contradiction: one chain concludes **John** tells the truth (the child is laughing), and the other concludes **John** lies (the child is not laughing). Since the two chains are of equal credibility and there's no rule to prioritize one over the other, we cannot definitively determine whether the child is laughing.

1. **Witness Matthew** says: ""The coffee is cold.""

2. **Witnesses who claim Matthew lies**:
   - Lainey
   - Angel
   - Ivan
   - Evan
   - Joseph
   - Camille
   - Tahlia

3. **Witnesses challenging the above accusers**:
   - **Zaria** claims Joseph lies.
   - **Calista** claims Camille lies.

4. **Witnesses challenging the challengers**:
   - **Marlee** claims Calista lies.
   - **Anthony** claims Marlee lies.
   - **Meadow** claims Samuel lies.
   - **Benjamin** claims Meadow lies.

Now, let's evaluate:

- **Lainey, Angel, Ivan, and Evan** accuse Matthew of lying. There is *no testimony* against them, so we *must* believe them.
  
- **Joseph** also accuses Matthew, but **Zaria** says Joseph lies. Since Zaria's testimony indicates Joseph might lie, we should distrust Joseph's accusation against Matthew.
  
- **Camille** accuses Matthew, but **Calista** says Camille lies. **Marlee** claims Calista lies, but then **Anthony** says Marlee lies. Since there's no testimony against Anthony, we believe him, meaning Marlee lies. Therefore, Calista tells the truth (Camille lies), so Camille's accusation against Matthew is false.
  
- **Tahlia** accuses Matthew, but **Samuel** says Tahlia lies. **Meadow** claims Samuel lies, but **Benjamin** says Meadow lies. With no testimony against Benjamin, we believe him, so Meadow lies, meaning Samuel tells the truth, and therefore Tahlia lies.
  
**Conclusion**:

- **Matthew** is accused of lying by **Lainey, Angel, Ivan, and Evan**, all of whom we have no reason to distrust.
- The accusations against Matthew by **Joseph, Camille, and Tahlia** are invalidated by testimonies indicating they might lie.
  
Since multiple trusted witnesses say Matthew lies, we conclude Matthew is lying about the coffee being cold.

Question: is the dog barking?
End your answer with: ""Answer: yes or no""","To determine whether the dog is barking, we need to analyze the witnesses' statements and assess their credibility based on the given instructions: witnesses should be believed unless there is testimony that they might lie.

**Witness Stormy** says that the dog is barking.

**Witnesses Claiming Stormy Lies:**
1. **William** says Stormy lies. No one says William lies, so William is credible.
2. **Malia** says Stormy lies. No one says Malia lies, so Malia is credible.
3. **Grace** says Stormy lies. However, **Eithne** says Grace lies, and this chain leads us to **Karina**, who is credible and indicates that Grace might be lying.
4. **Willow** says Stormy lies. **Vivienne** says Willow lies, and following the chain to **Rina**, who is credible, we find that Willow might be lying.
5. **Nora** says Stormy lies. **Ophelia** says Nora lies, and following the chain to **Penelope**, who is credible, we find that Nora might be lying.

**Conclusion:**
- **Credible Witnesses Against Stormy**: William and Malia.
- **Witnesses Whose Credibility Is Undermined**: Grace, Willow, and Nora.

Since only William and Malia are credible witnesses who testify that Stormy lies, and there's no testimony that they might lie, we should believe them per the instructions.

Therefore, Stormy's claim that the dog is barking is untrustworthy due to credible testimony that she lies.

Question: is the ocean deep?
End your answer with: ""Answer: yes or no""","To solve this reasoning puzzle, we use the principle that witnesses are to be believed unless there's testimony that they might lie. Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. **Robert says the ocean is deep.**
   - **David says Robert lies.**
     - **Nia says David lies.** Since no one accuses Nia of lying, we believe her, so David is lying. Therefore, Robert is not lying based on David's false accusation.
   
2. **Jaylani says Robert lies.**
   - **Bella says Jaylani lies.**
     - **Daxton says Bella lies.**
       - **Adalyn says Daxton lies.**
         - **Emersyn says Adalyn lies.**

                 - **Soraya says Jett lies.**
                   - **Saia says Soraya lies.**
                     - **Lyla says Saia lies.**
                       - **Liana says Lyla lies.** Since no one accuses Liana of lying, we believe her, making Lyla a liar.
                       
Following this chain back:
- Lyla is lying when she says Saia lies, so Saia tells the truth.
- Saia says Soraya lies; thus, Soraya is lying.
- Soraya lies about Jett lying; therefore, Jett tells the truth.
- Jett says Marlee lies; thus, Marlee is lying.
- Marlee lies about Kieran lying; therefore, Kieran tells the truth.
- Kieran says Emersyn lies; thus, Emersyn is lying.
- Emersyn lies about Adalyn lying; therefore, Adalyn tells the truth.
- Adalyn says Daxton lies; thus, Daxton is lying.
- Daxton lies about Bella lying; therefore, Bella tells the truth.
- Bella says Jaylani lies; thus, Jaylani is lying.

Since both David and Jaylani are proven liars in their claims that Robert lies, and there's no credible evidence against Robert, we conclude that Robert tells the truth.

1. **Janiyah says that the day is long.** *(No one has accused Janiyah of lying prior to this.)*

2. **Skye claims that Janiyah lies.** *(Skye accuses Janiyah.)*

3. **Kinsley claims that Skye lies.** *(No one has accused Kinsley, so we believe Kinsley.)*

   - **Therefore, Skye is lying.** Since Skye lies about Janiyah, Janiyah is telling the truth.

4. **Micah claims that Janiyah lies.**

5. **Ayleen claims that Micah lies.** *(No one has accused Ayleen, so we believe Ayleen.)*

   - **Therefore, Micah is lying.** Since Micah lies about Janiyah, Janiyah is telling the truth.

6. **Alaina claims that Janiyah lies.**

7. **Melina claims that Alaina lies.** *(No one has accused Melina, so we believe Melina.)*

9. **Colton claims that Lux lies.**

10. **Dominic claims that Colton lies.**

11. **Holden claims that Dominic lies.** *(No one has accused Holden, so we believe Holden.)*

Let's analyze the chain of testimonies:

1. **Merrin** says that the weather is nice.

2. However, **Bella** claims that Merrin lies.
   - **Camila** claims that Bella lies.
   - There's no testimony against Camila, so we believe her.

End your answer with: ""Answer: yes or no""","To solve this reasoning puzzle, we must determine whether the cat is meowing based on the testimonies of witnesses. The key rule is that witnesses are to be believed unless there is testimony that they might lie.

1. **Witness Beckham** says the cat is meowing.

3. **Witnesses Eithne, Charlie, and Henry** claim that Aubrey, Monroe, and Penelope, respectively, lie.
4. **Witnesses Kyla, Jovan, and Roman** claim that Eithne, Charlie, and Henry, respectively, lie.
5. **Witnesses Keely, Isabella, Mabel, Amari, and Avery** provide further claims about who is lying in the chain.

Starting from the end of the chain and working backward:

- **Avery** is believed (no one says Avery lies). Avery says **Amari** lies.
- Therefore, **Amari** is lying when claiming **Mabel** lies. So, Mabel tells the truth.
- **Mabel** says **Isabella** lies. Thus, Isabella is lying.
- **Isabella** lies about **Keely** lying, so Keely tells the truth.
- **Keely** says **Roman** lies. Therefore, Roman is lying.
- **Roman** lies about **Henry** lying, so Henry tells the truth.
- **Henry** says **Penelope** lies. Therefore, Penelope is lying about Beckham lying.
- Since **Penelope** is lying, Beckham does not lie according to her testimony.

Similarly, considering the other witnesses:

- **Kyla** is believed and says **Eithne** lies, so Eithne is lying about **Aubrey** lying.
- Therefore, **Aubrey** tells the truth when she says Beckham lies.
- However, this creates a contradiction because **Beckham** cannot both lie and tell the truth.

           - **No one accuses Kynlee**, so we believe Kynlee.
           - Therefore, Lizbeth lies, Calliope tells the truth, so Davina lies, Penelope tells the truth.
   - **Emory** says Penelope lies.
     - **Sienna** says Emory lies.
       - **Leani** says Sienna lies.
         - **Callan** says Leani lies.
           - **No one accuses Callan**, so we believe Callan.
           - Therefore, Leani lies, Sienna tells the truth, Emory lies, Penelope tells the truth.

3. **Analysis:**
   - In the first two chains, unaccused witnesses (Hunter and Teagan) lead us to conclude Penelope lies.
   - In the next two chains, unaccused witnesses (Kynlee and Callan) lead us to conclude Penelope tells the truth.
   - However, more witnesses (Jackson and Kaylee) are determined to be truthful in stating Penelope lies, based on the testimony of unaccused witnesses.
   - Given that Penelope is accused of lying by witnesses who are themselves supported by unaccused witnesses, the preponderance of credible testimony suggests Penelope lies.

1. **Sienna** says the sky is blue.
2. **Ashlynn** claims that **Sienna** lies.
   - **Emersyn** claims that **Ashlynn** lies.
     - **Jace** claims that **Emersyn** lies.
       - No one says **Jace** lies, so we believe **Jace**.
     - Therefore, **Emersyn** lies about **Ashlynn** lying.
   - So, **Ashlynn** tells the truth that **Sienna** lies.

3. **Victoria** claims that **Sienna** lies.
   - **Anabella** claims that **Victoria** lies.
     - **Kieran** claims that **Anabella** lies.
       - **Sylvie** claims that **Kieran** lies.
         - No one says **Sylvie** lies, so we believe **Sylvie**.
       - Therefore, **Kieran** lies about **Anabella** lying.
     - So, **Anabella** tells the truth that **Victoria** lies.
   - Therefore, **Victoria** lies about **Sienna** lying.

4. **Eithne** claims that **Sienna** lies.
   - **Anaya** claims that **Eithne** lies.
     - **Elina** claims that **Anaya** lies.
       - **Jaxson** claims that **Elina** lies.
         - **Olivia** claims that **Jaxson** lies.
           - **Katherine** claims that **Olivia** lies.
             - **Callen** claims that **Katherine** lies.
               - No one says **Callen** lies, so we believe **Callen**.
             - Therefore, **Katherine** lies about **Olivia** lying.
           - So, **Olivia** tells the truth that **Jaxson** lies.
         - Therefore, **Jaxson** lies about **Elina** lying.
       - So, **Elina** tells the truth that **Anaya** lies.
     - Therefore, **Anaya** lies about **Eithne** lying.
   - So, **Eithne** tells the truth that **Sienna** lies.

Both **Ashlynn** and **Eithne** truthfully say that **Sienna** lies. Since **Sienna** lies about the sky being blue, the sky is not blue.

0,15,"(3, 5, 6)","The following is a reasoning puzzle. Witnesses should be believed unless there is testimony that they might lie. A Now consider the following facts:
Witness Alani says that the stars are shining.
Witness Jolene claims that witness Alani lies.
Witness Millie claims that witness Jolene lies.
Witness Rylan claims that witness Millie lies.
Witness Faye claims that witness Alani lies.
Witness Devyn claims that witness Faye lies.
Witness Alistair claims that witness Devyn lies.
Witness Isaac claims that witness Alistair lies.
Witness Elowen claims that witness Isaac lies.
Witness Thomas claims that witness Alani lies.
Witness Ethan claims that witness Thomas lies.
Witness Emma claims that witness Ethan lies.
Witness Journey claims that witness Emma lies.
Witness Hudson claims that witness Journey lies.
Witness Farrah claims that witness Hudson lies.
Question: are the stars shining?
End your answer with: ""Answer: yes or no""","To solve this puzzle, we need to determine whether Alani's statement that ""the stars are shining"" is trustworthy, given the testimonies of the other witnesses and the rule that witnesses should be believed unless there is testimony that they might lie.

1. **Alani says the stars are shining.**

2. **Jolene says Alani lies.** Since there's no unchallenged testimony that Jolene lies, we should believe Jolene, which means Alani might be lying.

3. **Millie says Jolene lies.** However, **Rylan says Millie lies**, and no one says Rylan lies. Therefore, Millie's testimony is unreliable, and Jolene's credibility remains intact.

4. **Faye says Alani lies.** **Devyn says Faye lies**, but **Alistair says Devyn lies**, **Isaac says Alistair lies**, and **Elowen says Isaac lies**. Since no one challenges Elowen, we trust her statement that Isaac lies, making Alistair's testimony (that Devyn lies) reliable. This chain ultimately supports Faye's credibility.

5. **Thomas says Alani lies.** **Ethan says Thomas lies**, but **Emma says Ethan lies**, **Journey says Emma lies**, **Hudson says Journey lies**, and **Farrah says Hudson lies**. Farrah is unchallenged, so we believe Hudson lies, making Journey's testimony against Emma credible and casting doubt on Emma's claim that Ethan lies. Therefore, Ethan's statement that Thomas lies is trustworthy, making Thomas's testimony unreliable.

In summary, Jolene and Faye's credible testimonies indicate that Alani is lying about the stars shining, and there's no unchallenged testimony supporting Alani's truthfulness.

Witness Leo claims that witness Sebastian lies.
Witness Leani claims that witness Leo lies.
Witness Madison claims that witness Leani lies.
Question: is the towel wet?
End your answer with: ""Answer: yes or no""","To determine whether the towel is wet, we'll analyze the statements of the witnesses, considering that witnesses are to be believed unless there is testimony that they might lie.

1. **Mary** says the towel is wet.
   - **Harper** claims that **Mary** lies.
   
2. **Harper's** credibility:
   - **Etta** claims that **Harper** lies.
     - No one claims that **Etta** lies (since **Kaydence's** claim is invalidated below), so **Etta** is trustworthy.
   - Therefore, **Harper** might lie, and we cannot rely on their testimony against **Mary**.

3. **Mary's** credibility is restored since **Harper's** claim is undermined.

4. **Tahlia** claims that **Mary** lies.
   - **Zada** claims that **Tahlia** lies.
     - **Aurora** claims that **Zada** lies.
       - **Samuel** claims that **Aurora** lies.
         - **Sebastian** claims that **Samuel** lies.
           - **Leo** claims that **Sebastian** lies.
             - **Leani** claims that **Leo** lies.
               - **Madison** claims that **Leani** lies.
                 - No one claims that **Madison** lies, so **Madison** is trustworthy.
               - Therefore, **Leani** might lie; **Leo's** credibility is restored.
             - **Leo** is trustworthy; **Sebastian** might lie.
           - **Sebastian** might lie; **Samuel's** credibility is restored.
         - **Samuel** is trustworthy; **Aurora** might lie.
       - **Aurora** might lie; **Zada's** credibility is restored.
     - **Zada** is trustworthy; **Tahlia** might lie.
   - Therefore, **Tahlia's** claim against **Mary** is undermined.

5. **Mary's** credibility is further strengthened since both claims against her (by **Harper** and **Tahlia**) are from witnesses who might lie.

6. Since there is no valid testimony that **Mary** might lie, we can believe her statement that the towel is wet.
