Witness Theo says that the bird is flying.
Witness Juliet says that witness Theo is lying.
Witness Isla says that witness Juliet is lying.
Question: should it be believed that the bird is flying?
End your answer with: ""Answer: yes or no""","To determine whether we should believe that the bird is flying, let's analyze the witnesses' statements according to the given principle: **Witnesses should be believed unless there is testimony that they are lying.**

1. **Theo says:** ""The bird is flying.""
   - Theo should be believed unless there is testimony that he is lying.

2. **Juliet says:** ""Theo is lying.""
   - This is testimony that Theo is lying. According to the principle, we should now **not** believe Theo's statement.

3. **Isla says:** ""Juliet is lying.""
   - This is testimony that Juliet is lying. Therefore, we should **not** believe Juliet's statement.

Since we have testimony that Juliet is lying, we disregard her statement that Theo is lying. Without Juliet's accusation, there is no testimony against Theo. Thus, we revert to believing Theo's original statement.

**Conclusion:** We should believe Theo's statement that the bird is flying.

Witness Jeremiah says that witness Arabelle is lying.
Witness Stella says that witness Jeremiah is lying.
Witness Lyric says that witness Stella is lying.
Witness Harper says that witness Lyric is lying.
Question: should it be believed that the pizza is delicious?
End your answer with: ""Answer: yes or no""","To determine whether it should be believed that the pizza is delicious, let's analyze the chain of testimonies step by step, following the rule: **Witnesses should be believed unless there is testimony that they are lying.**

1. **Arabelle (A)** says: *""The pizza is delicious.""*
   - **Accused of lying by Jeremiah (J)**.
2. **Jeremiah (J)** says: *""Arabelle is lying.""*
   - **Accused of lying by Stella (S)**.
3. **Stella (S)** says: *""Jeremiah is lying.""*
   - **Accused of lying by Lyric (L)**.
4. **Lyric (L)** says: *""Stella is lying.""*
   - **Accused of lying by Harper (H)**.
5. **Harper (H)** says: *""Lyric is lying.""*
   - **Not accused of lying by anyone.**

Following the rule, since **Harper is not accused of lying**, we **believe Harper**'s statement that **Lyric is lying**.

- Since **Lyric is lying**, her claim that **Stella is lying** is false, so **Stella is telling the truth**.
- Since **Stella is telling the truth**, her statement that **Jeremiah is lying** is true.
- Since **Jeremiah is lying**, his claim that **Arabelle is lying** is false, so **Arabelle is telling the truth**.
- Since **Arabelle is telling the truth**, we should believe her statement that **the pizza is delicious**.

Witness Isabella says that witness Everett is lying.
Witness Jorja says that witness Isabella is lying.
Witness Lillian says that witness Jorja is lying.
Witness Jovie says that witness Lillian is lying.
Question: should it be believed that the air is humid?
End your answer with: ""Answer: yes or no""","To determine whether it should be believed that the air is humid, let's analyze the chain of testimonies step by step, adhering strictly to the rule that witnesses should be believed unless there is testimony that they are lying.

1. **Zuri says that the air is humid.**  
   - **Initial Position**: We believe Zuri because there is no testimony against her yet.

2. **Everett says that Zuri is lying.**  
   - **Impact**: We believe Everett (since no one has called him a liar yet), which means we now believe that Zuri is lying.

3. **Isabella says that Everett is lying.**  
   - **Impact**: We believe Isabella (no testimony against her yet), so Everett is lying. Thus, we revert to believing Zuri is telling the truth.

4. **Jorja says that Isabella is lying.**  
   - **Impact**: We believe Jorja, so Isabella is lying, which means Everett is telling the truth, and therefore, Zuri is lying.

5. **Lillian says that Jorja is lying.**  
   - **Impact**: We believe Lillian, so Jorja is lying, which means Isabella is telling the truth, Everett is lying, and Zuri is telling the truth.

6. **Jovie says that Lillian is lying.**  
   - **Impact**: We believe Jovie, so Lillian is lying, which makes Jorja truthful, meaning Isabella is lying, Everett is telling the truth, and thus, Zuri is lying.

After considering all testimonies, we have an **odd number of accusations** against the chain leading back to Zuri. With each accusation flipping our belief, an odd number ultimately results in the opposite of our initial position. Therefore, we end up **not believing Zuri's statement**.

Witness Eithne says that witness Lily is lying.
Witness Millie says that witness Eithne is lying.
Witness Ayleen says that witness Millie is lying.
Witness Saia says that witness Ayleen is lying.
Question: should it be believed that the milk is warm?
End your answer with: ""Answer: yes or no""","To determine whether we should believe that the milk is warm based on the witnesses' statements, let's analyze the chain of testimonies step by step, using the rule that ""witnesses should be believed unless there is testimony that they are lying.""

1. **Charles** says: ""The milk is warm.""  
   We believe Charles unless someone says he's lying.

2. **Brooklyn** says: ""Charles is lying.""  
   Now, there's testimony against Charles, so unless we have reason to believe Brooklyn is lying, we cannot accept Charles's statement.

3. **Lily** says: ""Brooklyn is lying.""  
   We have testimony that Brooklyn is lying, so we can now believe that Brooklyn is lying (unless someone says Lily is lying).

4. **Eithne** says: ""Lily is lying.""  
   Eithne testifies that Lily is lying, so we have reason to believe that Lily is lying, thus Brooklyn is telling the truth.

5. **Millie** says: ""Eithne is lying.""  
   Millie's testimony gives us reason to believe Eithne is lying, so Lily is telling the truth, and Brooklyn is lying.

6. **Ayleen** says: ""Millie is lying.""  
   Ayleen's statement suggests Millie is lying, so Eithne is telling the truth, Lily is lying, and Brooklyn is telling the truth.

7. **Saia** says: ""Ayleen is lying.""  
   Saia's testimony means Ayleen is lying, so Millie is telling the truth, Eithne is lying, Lily is telling the truth, and Brooklyn is lying.

Analyzing the pattern, we notice that with an even number of testimonies against previous witnesses (excluding Charles), the final outcome is that Charles is telling the truth. In this case, there are 6 witnesses after Charles, which is an even number, leading us to believe that Charles is telling the truth.

Witness Remi says that witness Skylar is lying.
Question: should it be believed that the computer is on?
End your answer with: ""Answer: yes or no""","To determine whether the computer is on, we need to assess the credibility of each witness based on the given rules:

1. Witnesses should be believed unless there is testimony that they are lying.
2. If a witness is said to be lying by another, we need to evaluate whether we believe the accuser.

Here's the chain of statements:

- **Linnea** says that the computer is **on**.
- **Saige** says that **Linnea** is lying.
- **Zuri** says that **Saige** is lying.
- **Luke** says that **Zuri** is lying.
- **Leo** says that **Luke** is lying.
- **Kiera** says that **Leo** is lying.
- **Skylar** says that **Kiera** is lying.
- **Remi** says that **Skylar** is lying.

Now, we'll proceed step by step:

1. **Remi** (Witness 8) says **Skylar** is lying. Since no one accuses **Remi** of lying, we believe **Remi**.
2. Therefore, **Skylar** (Witness 7) is lying.
3. Since **Skylar** is lying when she says **Kiera** is lying, we conclude that **Kiera** is telling the truth.
4. **Kiera** says **Leo** is lying. We believe **Kiera**, so **Leo** is lying.
5. Since **Leo** is lying when he says **Luke** is lying, **Luke** is telling the truth.
6. **Luke** says **Zuri** is lying. We believe **Luke**, so **Zuri** is lying.
7. Since **Zuri** is lying when she says **Saige** is lying, **Saige** is telling the truth.
8. **Saige** says **Linnea** is lying. We believe **Saige**, so **Linnea** is lying.

Therefore, **Linnea** is lying when she says the computer is on, so the computer is **not on**.

Question: should it be believed that the bike is clean?
End your answer with: ""Answer: yes or no""","To solve this reasoning puzzle, we need to determine whether we should believe witness Yara's statement that the bike is clean, given the chain of testimonies about other witnesses lying.

Starting from the last witness and working backward:

1. **Briar** says **Briella** is lying. No one accuses **Briar** of lying, so we believe **Briar** is telling the truth. Therefore, **Briella** is lying.
2. **Briella** (who is lying) says **Jenevieve** is lying. Since **Briella** is lying, **Jenevieve** is actually telling the truth.
3. **Jenevieve** (truthful) says **Vale** is lying. Therefore, **Vale** is lying.
4. **Vale** (lying) says **Brooks** is lying. Since **Vale** is lying, **Brooks** is telling the truth.
5. **Brooks** (truthful) says **Laila** is lying. Therefore, **Laila** is lying.
6. **Laila** (lying) says **Micah** is lying. Since **Laila** is lying, **Micah** is telling the truth.
7. **Micah** (truthful) says **Aveline** is lying. Therefore, **Aveline** is lying.
8. **Aveline** (lying) says **Yara** is lying. Since **Aveline** is lying, **Yara** is telling the truth.
9. **Yara** (truthful) says the bike is clean.

Therefore, we should believe that the bike is clean.

Question: should it be believed that the street is busy?
End your answer with: ""Answer: yes or no""","To solve this puzzle, we need to determine whether Taliah's statement that the street is busy should be believed, given the chain of witnesses each accusing the previous one of lying. The key rule is that witnesses are believed unless there is testimony that they are lying.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Taliah says the street is busy.** We would believe her unless someone says she's lying.
2. **Josephine says Taliah is lying.** Now, we have reason to doubt Taliah.
3. **Callan says Josephine is lying.** This suggests Josephine might be lying about Taliah lying, so we could believe Taliah again.
4. **Isaiah says Callan is lying.** This casts doubt on Callan's statement, bringing us back to doubting Taliah.
5. **Indigo says Isaiah is lying.** Now, Isaiah's statement is in doubt, so we might believe Callan again and thus Taliah.
6. **Elina says Indigo is lying.** This flips our belief back to doubting Taliah.
7. **Sawyer says Elina is lying.** We flip again to believing Taliah.
8. **Gianna says Sawyer is lying.** We flip back to doubting Taliah.
9. **Lizbeth says Gianna is lying.** We flip again to believing Taliah.
10. **Mabel says Lizbeth is lying.** Finally, we flip back to doubting Taliah.

After considering all testimonies, we end up with an odd number of flips, resulting in not believing Taliah. Therefore, we should not believe that the street is busy.

We are told to believe a witness unless there is testimony that they are lying. Each witness from Aaron onward claims the previous witness is lying, creating a chain of contradictions.

By analyzing the sequence:
- The truthfulness of each witness alternates because each says the previous is lying.
- With an even number of witnesses (16), the chain ends with Adley saying Raegan is lying.
- This leads to the conclusion that Angel (the first witness) is lying.
- Therefore, Angel's statement that the bed is comfortable should not be believed.

Question: should it be believed that the rain is heavy?
End your answer with: ""Answer: yes or no""","To determine whether we should believe Asher's statement that ""the rain is heavy,"" we need to analyze the chain of witness testimonies.

15. **Mariah** says Lavinia is lying.
16. **Annika** says Mariah is lying.
17. **Tiana** says Annika is lying.

According to the instructions, witnesses are believed unless there's testimony that they are lying. Each witness is accusing the previous one of lying. This creates an alternating pattern of truth and lies.

Let's analyze the pattern:

- **Odd-numbered witnesses (starting from Tilly)** are accusing someone of lying, which, based on the chain, suggests Asher is lying.
- **Even-numbered witnesses (starting from Vale)** counter the previous accusation, suggesting Asher is telling the truth.

Since Tilly is the first to accuse (odd position), and there are 17 witnesses in total after Asher (an odd number), the final position is occupied by Tiana (odd position). However, when we count the number of accusations, Tiana is the 17th witness (even position in terms of the number of accusations), which means the pattern ends on an even number.

Following this pattern, the even-numbered witnesses support Asher telling the truth. Therefore, after considering all testimonies, we conclude that Asher is telling the truth.

Let's evaluate the truthfulness of each witness step by step:

- **Kailani** asserts the store is open. No prior testimony suggests she is lying, so we initially believe her.
- **Jeremiah** claims Kailani is lying. Without evidence that Jeremiah is lying, we now doubt Kailani.
- **Taliah** says Jeremiah is lying, restoring our belief in Kailani.
- **Xavier** claims Taliah is lying, so we again doubt Kailani.
- **Sawyer** says Xavier is lying, so we believe Taliah, and thus believe Kailani.
- **Suri** claims Sawyer is lying, leading us to doubt Taliah and Kailani again.
- **Luke** says Suri is lying, restoring our belief in Kailani.
- **Faye** claims Luke is lying, causing us to doubt Kailani once more.
- **Oaklee** says Faye is lying, so we believe Kailani again.
- **Calliope** claims Oaklee is lying, leading us to doubt Kailani.
- **Indigo** says Calliope is lying, restoring our belief in Kailani.
- **Eviana** claims Indigo is lying, so we doubt Kailani again.
- **Saia** says Eviana is lying, making us believe Kailani.
- **Keira** claims Saia is lying, leading us to doubt Kailani.
- **Benjamin** says Keira is lying, so we believe Kailani.
- **Austin** claims Benjamin is lying, causing us to doubt Kailani again.
- **Dylan** says Austin is lying, restoring our belief in Kailani.
- **Marlee** claims Dylan is lying, leading us to doubt Kailani.
- **Callie** says Marlee is lying, so we ultimately believe Kailani.

Since each witness alternately accuses the previous one of lying, and we believe witnesses unless someone says they're lying, the net effect after **Callie's** testimony is that we should believe **Kailani**.

We start from the end since no one has accused **Adam** of lying. 

- **Adam** is telling the truth.
- Therefore, **Robert** is lying (since Adam says Robert is lying).
- Since Robert is lying, **Greyson** is telling the truth.
- Continuing this pattern, we alternate truth values:

   - \( T(22) = \text{False} \)
   - \( T(21) = \text{True} \)
   - \( T(20) = \text{False} \)
   - ... and so on, up to \( T(1) \).

Witness Elara says that witness Colette is lying.
Witness Mason says that witness Elara is lying.
Question: should it be believed that the cake is sweet?
End your answer with: ""Answer: yes or no""","To solve this puzzle, let's analyze the chain of witnesses step by step. Each witness is either supporting or contradicting the previous witness's statement. We are told to believe a witness unless there's testimony that they are lying.

Here's the summarized sequence:

1. **Zaiden** says the cake is sweet.
2. **Lorelei** says Zaiden is lying.
3. **Maylin** says Lorelei is lying.
4. **Arabelle** says Maylin is lying.
5. **Jace** says Arabelle is lying.
6. **Layna** says Jace is lying.
7. **Emilia** says Layna is lying.
8. **Liora** says Emilia is lying.
9. **Brielle** says Liora is lying.
10. **Anthony** says Brielle is lying.
11. **Leani** says Anthony is lying.
12. **Raya** says Leani is lying.
13. **Ace** says Raya is lying.
14. **Elysia** says Ace is lying.
15. **Olwen** says Elysia is lying.

19. **Davina** says Rhett is lying.
20. **Gabriel** says Davina is lying.
21. **Daniel** says Gabriel is lying.
22. **Sofia** says Daniel is lying.
23. **Colette** says Sofia is lying.
24. **Elara** says Colette is lying.
25. **Mason** says Elara is lying.

Now, let's determine the truth about Zaiden's statement:

- Each witness after Zaiden is claiming that the previous witness is lying.
- This creates a chain of contradictions.

We can observe that:

- When there's an **even** number of people saying ""the previous person is lying,"" the initial statement remains **true**.
- When there's an **odd** number, the initial statement becomes **false**.

In this case, there are **24 witnesses** after Zaiden making the ""lying"" claims, which is an **even** number. Therefore, the chain of contradictions results in Zaiden's original statement being **true**.

**Conclusion**: We should believe that the cake is sweet.

Witness Harrison says that witness Isha is lying.
Question: should it be believed that the pizza is delicious?
End your answer with: ""Answer: yes or no""","To determine whether the pizza should be believed to be delicious, let's analyze the witnesses' statements according to the given rule: ""Witnesses should be believed unless there is testimony that they are lying.""

1. **Mary says the pizza is delicious.**
   - No one has testified that Mary is lying except Annika.

2. **Annika says that Mary is lying.**
   - No one has testified that Annika is lying except Isha.

3. **Isha says that Annika is lying.**
   - No one has testified that Isha is lying except Harrison.

4. **Harrison says that Isha is lying.**
   - No one has testified that Harrison is lying.

Given that no one has testified that **Harrison** is lying, we must believe Harrison according to the rule. Since Harrison says that **Isha** is lying, we accept that Isha is lying.

If **Isha** is lying about Annika lying, it means that Annika is actually **telling the truth**.

Since **Annika** is telling the truth when she says that **Mary is lying**, we accept that Mary is lying about the pizza being delicious.

Therefore, we should **not** believe that the pizza is delicious.

Question: should it be believed that the sky is cloudy?
End your answer with: ""Answer: yes or no""","To solve this puzzle, we'll use logical reasoning based on the provided testimonies and the rule that witnesses should be believed unless there's testimony that they're lying. Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. **Norah says**: ""The sky is cloudy.""
   - No initial reason to doubt Norah unless someone says she's lying.

2. **Saffron says**: ""Norah is lying.""
   - This introduces doubt about Norah's statement.

3. **Kaydence says**: ""Saffron is lying.""
   - Suggests that Saffron's claim about Norah is false.

4. **Kamara says**: ""Kaydence is lying.""
   - Implies that Kaydence's statement about Saffron is false.

5. **Jaylani says**: ""Kamara is lying.""
   - Indicates Kamara's claim about Kaydence is false.

Now, let's apply the rule:

- **Jaylani** is trusted (no one says Jaylani is lying), so **Kamara is lying**.
- Since Kamara is lying about Kaydence lying, that means **Kaydence is telling the truth**.
- Kaydence truthfully says that **Saffron is lying**.
- Therefore, **Saffron is lying** about Norah.
- Since Saffron is lying about Norah lying, **Norah is telling the truth**.

Question: should it be believed that the car is fast?
End your answer with: ""Answer: yes or no""","To solve this problem, we'll apply the rule that witnesses should be believed unless there is testimony that they are lying. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Logan** says the car is fast.
2. **Dylan** says **Logan** is lying.
3. **Nikolas** says **Dylan** is lying.
4. **John** says **Nikolas** is lying.
5. **Linnea** says **John** is lying.

11. **Faye** says **Jovie** is lying.
12. **Salvador** says **Faye** is lying.
13. **Skye** says **Salvador** is lying.

Now, we proceed backward to determine whom to believe:

- **Skye** is believed because no one says **Skye** is lying.
- Therefore, **Salvador** is lying (since **Skye** says so).
- Since **Salvador** is lying, **Faye** is telling the truth.
- **Faye** says **Jovie** is lying; thus, **Jovie** is lying.
- **Jovie** lies about **Aurora**; so, **Aurora** is telling the truth.
- **Aurora** says **Solara** is lying; hence, **Solara** is lying.
- **Solara** lies about **Lillian**; therefore, **Lillian** is telling the truth.
- **Lillian** says **Zaiden** is lying; so, **Zaiden** is lying.
- **Zaiden** lies about **Linnea**; thus, **Linnea** is telling the truth.
- **Linnea** says **John** is lying; therefore, **John** is lying.
- **John** lies about **Nikolas**; so, **Nikolas** is telling the truth.
- **Nikolas** says **Dylan** is lying; hence, **Dylan** is lying.
- **Dylan** lies about **Logan**; thus, **Logan** is telling the truth.

Since **Logan** is telling the truth that the car is fast, and there's no valid testimony against him, we should believe him.

Question: should it be believed that the towel is wet?
End your answer with: ""Answer: yes or no""","To solve this puzzle, we start by analyzing the chain of witness statements. Each witness from the second onwards accuses the previous witness of lying. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Tiana** says: ""The towel is wet.""
2. **Janiah** says: ""Tiana is lying.""
3. **Sabel** says: ""Janiah is lying.""
4. **Wynter** says: ""Sabel is lying.""

12. **Eva** says: ""Willow is lying.""
13. **Luke** says: ""Eva is lying.""
14. **Bria** says: ""Luke is lying.""

Given that witnesses are believed unless someone testifies that they are lying, and noting that Bria (the last witness) is not accused of lying by anyone, we accept her statement as true. 

Bria says that Luke is lying, so Luke is indeed lying. Luke said that Eva is lying, so since Luke is lying, Eva is actually telling the truth. Continuing this logic:

- Since Eva is telling the truth, Willow is lying (as Eva said Willow is lying).
- If Willow is lying, then Elijah is telling the truth (since Willow accused Elijah).
- Continuing this pattern, we find that Tiana (the first witness) is lying.

Since Tiana is lying about the towel being wet, we conclude that the towel is not wet.

- Therefore, **Isaiah** is lying. We should not believe **Isaiah**.
- **Isaiah** says **Kamryn** is lying. Since **Isaiah** is lying, **Kamryn** is telling the truth.
- **Kamryn** says **Lucas** is lying. We believe **Kamryn**, so **Lucas** is lying.
- **Lucas** says **Lorelei** is lying. Since **Lucas** is lying, **Lorelei** is telling the truth.
- **Lorelei** says **Jessamy** is lying. We believe **Lorelei**, so **Jessamy** is lying.

Let's analyze the testimonies in reverse order to see who we should believe:

1. **Ruby** says **Aidan** is lying. No one accuses Ruby of lying, so we believe Ruby. Therefore, **Aidan** is lying.

2. Since **Aidan** is lying, his statement that **Landon** is lying is false. Therefore, we believe **Landon**.

3. **Landon** says **Sorrel** is lying. We believe Landon, so **Sorrel** is lying.

4. Since **Sorrel** is lying, her statement that **Oakley** is lying is false. Therefore, we believe **Oakley**.

5. **Oakley** says **Farrah** is lying. We believe Oakley, so **Farrah** is lying.

6. Since **Farrah** is lying, her statement that **Ashby** is lying is false. Therefore, we believe **Ashby**.

7. **Ashby** says **Skylar** is lying. We believe Ashby, so **Skylar** is lying.

8. Since **Skylar** is lying, her statement that **Willow** is lying is false. Therefore, we believe **Willow**.

15. **Kinsley** says Keira is lying.
16. **Freya** says Kinsley is lying.
17. **Indigo** says Freya is lying.

Starting from the end:

- **Indigo** is the last witness, and no one claims Indigo is lying. So, Indigo is telling the truth, meaning **Freya** is lying.
- Since Freya (lying) says Kinsley is lying, we conclude **Kinsley** is telling the truth.
- Kinsley says **Keira** is lying.
- Therefore, Keira is lying when she says **Sariyah** is lying.
- So, **Sariyah** is telling the truth and says **Maylin** is lying.
- **Maylin** is lying when she says **Isaiah** is lying.
- Hence, **Isaiah** tells the truth, stating **Annabelle** is lying.
- **Annabelle** is lying about **Dylan** lying.
- Thus, **Dylan** tells the truth, saying **Kyson** is lying.
- **Kyson** is lying when he says **Hattie** is lying.
- Therefore, **Hattie** tells the truth, indicating **Wynter** is lying.
- **Wynter** is lying about **Alia** lying.
- So, **Alia** tells the truth, stating **Angela** is lying.
- **Angela** is lying when she says **Zalia** is lying.
- Hence, **Zalia** tells the truth, indicating **Adrian** is lying.

Since no one claims that **Solara** is lying, we accept her statement as true. Following this logic backwards:

- **Solara** is telling the truth; therefore, **Ariana** is lying.
- **Ariana** (who is lying) falsely claims that **Katherine** is lying; thus, **Katherine** is telling the truth.
- **Katherine** says **Callista** is lying; so **Callista** is lying.
- **Callista** (who is lying) falsely claims **Mila** is lying; thus, **Mila** is telling the truth.

Starting from the last witness:

- **Devyn (Witness 19)**: No one accuses Devyn of lying. Therefore, we believe Devyn, who says that Angela is lying.
- Since **Angela (Witness 18)** is lying (as per Devyn), her statement that Alana is lying is false. Therefore, **Alana (Witness 17)** is telling the truth.
- **Alana** says that Ashlynn is lying. So, **Ashlynn (Witness 16)** is lying.
- Since **Ashlynn** is lying about Grace lying, it means **Grace (Witness 15)** is telling the truth.
- **Grace** says that Asher is lying. So, **Asher (Witness 14)** is lying.
- Since **Asher** is lying about Rylan lying, **Rylan (Witness 13)** is telling the truth.
- **Rylan** says that Aracely is lying. So, **Aracely (Witness 12)** is lying.
- Since **Aracely** is lying about Kassidy lying, **Kassidy (Witness 11)** is telling the truth.
- **Kassidy** says that Harley is lying. So, **Harley (Witness 10)** is lying.
- Since **Harley** is lying about Amira lying, **Amira (Witness 9)** is telling the truth.

- Since **Ivan** is lying about Lucian lying, **Lucian (Witness 5)** is telling the truth.
- **Lucian** says that Lorelei is lying. So, **Lorelei (Witness 4)** is lying.
- Since **Lorelei** is lying about Jeremiah lying, **Jeremiah (Witness 3)** is telling the truth.
- **Jeremiah** says that Olivia is lying. So, **Olivia (Witness 2)** is lying.
- Since **Olivia** is lying about Jaxson lying, **Jaxson (Witness 1)** is telling the truth.

Observing the pattern:
- If the number of witnesses is **even** (which is 20 here), Robert is ultimately deemed **lying**.
- If the number of witnesses is **odd**, Robert would be deemed **truthful**.

Since there are 20 witnesses, and the chain ends with Lux saying Kai is lying, the even number of contradictions leads us to conclude that Robert is lying about the fruit being sweet.

- **Final Witness Azura** says **Callan is lying**.
   - **We believe Azura** (since no one says she is lying).

Now, let's work backward to determine the truthfulness of each witness:

1. **Azura** is telling the truth, so **Callan is lying**.
2. **Callan** is lying about **Kassidy**, so **Kassidy is telling the truth**.
3. **Kassidy** says **Saige is lying**, so **Saige is lying**.
4. **Saige** is lying about **Isaac**, so **Isaac is telling the truth**.
5. **Isaac** says **Gracie is lying**, so **Gracie is lying**.

8. **Chloe** is lying about **Camryn**, so **Camryn is telling the truth**.
9. **Camryn** says **Freya is lying**, so **Freya is lying**.
10. **Freya** is lying about **Aubree**, so **Aubree is telling the truth**.
11. **Aubree** says **Autumn is lying**, so **Autumn is lying**.
12. **Autumn** is lying about **Calista**, so **Calista is telling the truth**.
13. **Calista** says **Alia is lying**, so **Alia is lying**.

- Each witness accuses the previous one of lying.
- This creates a chain where the truth about Hudson's statement alternates with each new accusation.
- When the number of accusations after Hudson is **even**, we end up believing Hudson.

There are **24 witnesses** accusing prior witnesses (from Ariana to Eviana), which is an even number. Therefore, we conclude that Hudson is telling the truth.

4. **Jordan** says that Henry is lying.

According to the rules:
- Witnesses should be believed **unless there is testimony that they are lying**.
- A witness's accusation that another witness is lying counts as testimony that the accused witness is lying.

**Step-by-step Analysis:**

- **Jordan**: No one accuses Jordan of lying. Therefore, we should believe Jordan.
  - **Jordan says Henry is lying**.
- **Henry**: Since Jordan (a credible witness) says Henry is lying, we have testimony that Henry is lying. Therefore, we should **not** believe Henry.
- **Elira**: No credible witness accuses Elira of lying (Henry does, but he's not credible because we've established he's lying). Therefore, we should believe Elira.
  - **Elira says Zaiden is lying**.
- **Zaiden**: Since Elira (a credible witness) says Zaiden is lying, we have testimony that Zaiden is lying. Therefore, we should **not** believe Zaiden about the train being late.

   - Is there testimony that Raya is lying? **Yes**, **Leani** says that Raya is lying.

5. **Leani** says that Raya is lying.
   - Is there testimony that Leani is lying? **No**, so we believe Leani.

Since we believe Leani, we accept that **Raya is lying**. Therefore, Raya's statement that Isla is lying is false, so **Isla is not lying**.

End your answer with: ""Answer: yes or no""","To solve this puzzle, we need to determine whether Robert, who says ""the train is late,"" should be believed. Witnesses are to be believed unless there's credible testimony that they are lying. Let's analyze the chain of testimonies:

1. **Robert** says the train is late.
2. **Jorja** says Robert is lying.
3. **Briar** says Jorja is lying.
4. **Delilah** says Briar is lying.
5. **Juniper** says Delilah is lying.
6. **Josiah** says Juniper is lying.
7. **Kinley** says Josiah is lying.
8. **Lucian** says Kinley is lying.
9. **Leila** says Lucian is lying.

Starting from the end:

- **Leila** has no one accusing her of lying, so we believe her when she says **Lucian** is lying.
- Since **Lucian** is lying about **Kinley** lying, **Kinley** is telling the truth.
- **Kinley** truthfully says **Josiah** is lying.
- Therefore, **Josiah** is lying about **Juniper** lying, so **Juniper** is telling the truth.
- **Juniper** truthfully says **Delilah** is lying.
- Thus, **Delilah** is lying about **Briar** lying, so **Briar** is telling the truth.
- **Briar** truthfully says **Jorja** is lying.
- Therefore, **Jorja** is lying about **Robert** lying, so **Robert** is telling the truth.

Since **Robert** is telling the truth when he says the train is late, we should believe that the train is late.

Witness Noa says that witness Jenevieve is lying.
Witness Genesis says that witness Noa is lying.
Question: should it be believed that the pasta is ready?
End your answer with: ""Answer: yes or no""","To solve this reasoning puzzle, we'll follow the chain of witnesses and determine whether each is telling the truth or lying, based on the testimonies provided and the instruction that witnesses should be believed unless there is testimony that they are lying.

1. **Angel** says: *The pasta is ready*.
2. **Jonathan** says: *Angel is lying*.
3. **Amelia** says: *Jonathan is lying*.
4. **Keely** says: *Amelia is lying*.
5. **Melody** says: *Keely is lying*.
6. **Kenna** says: *Melody is lying*.
7. **Quincy** says: *Kenna is lying*.
8. **Jenevieve** says: *Quincy is lying*.
9. **Noa** says: *Jenevieve is lying*.
10. **Genesis** says: *Noa is lying*.

We'll proceed step by step:

- **Assume Angel is telling the truth** (since no one has yet said she's lying).
- **Jonathan** accuses Angel of lying. **Since no one has yet accused Jonathan of lying**, we believe him, so **Angel is lying**.
- **Amelia** says Jonathan is lying. **No one has accused Amelia of lying yet**, so we believe her, meaning **Jonathan is lying**, so **Angel is telling the truth**.
- **Keely** says Amelia is lying. We believe Keely (no accusations against her), so **Amelia is lying**, which means **Jonathan is telling the truth**, so **Angel is lying**.
- **Melody** says Keely is lying. Believing Melody, **Keely is lying**, so **Amelia is telling the truth**, so **Jonathan is lying**, so **Angel is telling the truth**.
- **Kenna** says Melody is lying. Believing Kenna, **Melody is lying**, so **Keely is telling the truth**, so **Amelia is lying**, so **Jonathan is telling the truth**, so **Angel is lying**.
- **Quincy** says Kenna is lying. Believing Quincy, **Kenna is lying**, so **Melody is telling the truth**, so **Keely is lying**, so **Amelia is telling the truth**, so **Jonathan is lying**, so **Angel is telling the truth**.
- **Jenevieve** says Quincy is lying. Believing Jenevieve, **Quincy is lying**, so **Kenna is telling the truth**, so **Melody is lying**, so **Keely is telling the truth**, so **Amelia is lying**, so **Jonathan is telling the truth**, so **Angel is lying**.
- **Noa** says Jenevieve is lying. Believing Noa, **Jenevieve is lying**, so **Quincy is telling the truth**, so **Kenna is lying**, so **Melody is telling the truth**, so **Keely is lying**, so **Amelia is telling the truth**, so **Jonathan is lying**, so **Angel is telling the truth**.
- **Genesis** says Noa is lying. Believing Genesis, **Noa is lying**, so **Jenevieve is telling the truth**, so **Quincy is lying**, so **Kenna is telling the truth**, so **Melody is lying**, so **Keely is telling the truth**, so **Amelia is lying**, so **Jonathan is telling the truth**, so **Angel is lying**.

The pattern shows that with each new witness, the truth about Angel's statement flips. Since there are 10 witnesses testifying about others lying, and 10 is an even number, **the final conclusion is that Angel is lying**.

10. **Briella** says Bria is lying.
11. **Kyrah** says Briella is lying.

According to the instructions, witnesses are to be believed unless there is testimony that they are lying. We start from the last witness and proceed backward:

- **Kyrah** makes no claims about herself lying, so we believe her when she says **Briella** is lying.
- Since **Briella** is lying about **Bria** lying, **Bria** is telling the truth.
- **Bria** says **Freya** is lying, so **Freya** is lying.
- Since **Freya** is lying about **Tessa** lying, **Tessa** is telling the truth.
- **Tessa** says **Renata** is lying, so **Renata** is lying.
- Since **Renata** is lying about **Olwen** lying, **Olwen** is telling the truth.
- **Olwen** says **Chloe** is lying, so **Chloe** is lying.
- Since **Chloe** is lying about **Elira** lying, **Elira** is telling the truth.
- **Elira** says **Annabelle** is lying, so **Annabelle** is lying.
- Since **Annabelle** is lying about **Kiera** lying, **Kiera** is telling the truth.

Therefore, we should believe **Kiera** when she says the homework is difficult.

End your answer with: ""Answer: yes or no""","To solve this reasoning puzzle, we need to determine whether Cassius's statement that ""the cat is meowing"" should be believed, given the testimonies provided by the other witnesses. The key principle is that witnesses should be believed unless there is testimony that they are lying.

Let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Cassius** says: *The cat is meowing.*
2. **Allison** says: *Cassius is lying.*
3. **Eli** says: *Allison is lying.*
4. **Ethan** says: *Eli is lying.*

10. **Saige** says: *Mary is lying.*
11. **Jett** says: *Saige is lying.*
12. **Amity** says: *Jett is lying.*

Now, working from the last witness backward:

- **Amity** says Jett is lying. There's no testimony against Amity, so we believe her, making **Jett** a liar.
- Since **Jett** is lying about Saige, **Saige** is telling the truth.
- **Saige** says Mary is lying. There's no testimony against Saige, so **Mary** is lying.
- **Mary** is lying about Liana, so **Liana** is telling the truth.
- **Liana** says Leah is lying. There's no testimony against Liana, so **Leah** is lying.
- **Leah** is lying about Lily, so **Lily** is telling the truth.
- **Lily** says Amayah is lying. There's no testimony against Lily, so **Amayah** is lying.
- **Amayah** is lying about Ethan, so **Ethan** is telling the truth.
- **Ethan** says Eli is lying. There's no testimony against Ethan, so **Eli** is lying.
- **Eli** is lying about Allison, so **Allison** is telling the truth.
- **Allison** says Cassius is lying. There's no testimony against Allison, so **Cassius** is lying.

Therefore, Cassius's statement that ""the cat is meowing"" is a lie.

End your answer with: ""Answer: yes or no""","To solve this puzzle, we need to determine whether the candle is lit based on the witnesses' statements, following the rule: ""Witnesses should be believed unless there is testimony that they are lying.""

Let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Ivy** says the candle is lit.
2. **Connor** says that **Ivy** is lying.
   - Since no one has accused **Connor** of lying yet, we believe **Connor**, so **Ivy** is lying, and the candle is not lit.
3. **Mallory** says that **Connor** is lying.
   - We believe **Mallory**, so **Connor** is lying. Therefore, **Ivy** is telling the truth, and the candle is lit.
4. **Leo** says that **Mallory** is lying.
   - We believe **Leo**, so **Mallory** is lying. Therefore, **Connor** is telling the truth, **Ivy** is lying, and the candle is not lit.
5. **Madison** says that **Leo** is lying.
   - We believe **Madison**, so **Leo** is lying. Therefore, **Mallory** is telling the truth, **Connor** is lying, **Ivy** is telling the truth, and the candle is lit.
6. **Aris** says that **Madison** is lying.
   - We believe **Aris**, so **Madison** is lying. Thus, **Leo** is telling the truth, **Mallory** is lying, **Connor** is telling the truth, **Ivy** is lying, and the candle is not lit.
7. **Harrison** says that **Aris** is lying.
   - Following the same logic, this switches the belief back to the candle being lit.
8. **Colette** says that **Harrison** is lying.
   - This flips our belief again, leading to the candle not being lit.
9. **Reyna** says that **Colette** is lying.

14. **Micah** says **Ivan is lying**.
15. **Kamryn** says **Micah is lying**.

Starting from the last witness, Kamryn, who has no testimony against her, we believe her statement that **Micah is lying**.

- Since **Micah is lying**, his claim that **Ivan is lying** is false.
- Therefore, **Ivan** is telling the truth that **Kaylin is lying**.
- Since **Kaylin is lying**, her claim that **Logan is lying** is false.
- Therefore, **Logan** is telling the truth that **Julian is lying**.
- Since **Julian is lying**, his claim that **Talia is lying** is false.
- Therefore, **Talia** is telling the truth that **Farrah is lying**.
- Since **Farrah is lying**, her claim that **Taylor is lying** is false.
- Therefore, **Taylor** is telling the truth that **Easton is lying**.
- Since **Easton is lying**, his claim that **Charlotte is lying** is false.
- Therefore, **Charlotte** is telling the truth that **Lucy is lying**.
- Since **Lucy is lying**, her claim that **Lyla is lying** is false.
- Therefore, **Lyla** is telling the truth that **Octavia is lying**.
- Since **Octavia is lying**, her claim that **Theo is lying** is false.
- Therefore, **Theo** is telling the truth when he says **the lights are bright**.

Question: should it be believed that the plane is landing?
End your answer with: ""Answer: yes or no""","To determine if we should believe Aubrey's statement that the plane is landing, we need to follow the chain of testimonies and apply the rule that witnesses are believed unless there is testimony that they are lying.

Starting from the end:
- **Mila** says **Emory** is lying. No one accuses Mila of lying, so we believe Mila, which means Emory is lying.
- **Emory** says **Ryan** is lying. Since Emory is lying, we conclude Ryan is telling the truth.
- This pattern continues, alternating between witnesses being believed and not believed based on whether the person accusing them is considered truthful or not.

By tracing this pattern back to **Aubrey**:
- We find that **Cooper** is lying when he says Aubrey is lying.
- Therefore, **Aubrey** is telling the truth when she says the plane is landing.

Question: should it be believed that the dog is tired?
End your answer with: ""Answer: yes or no""","To determine whether we should believe that the dog is tired, let's analyze the chain of witness statements based on the given rule: **Witnesses should be believed unless there is testimony that they are lying**.

1. **Melanie** says the dog is tired.
   
2. **Grace** says that Melanie is lying.
   - We believe Grace unless there is testimony that she is lying.
   
3. **Malia** says that Grace is lying.
   - Now there's testimony that Grace is lying.
   - Therefore, we do **not** believe Grace.
   - This means we believe Melanie is **not** lying (since Grace's accusation is not credible).
   - So, we should believe Melanie's statement that the dog is tired.
   
4. **Anwen** says that Malia is lying.
   - There's now testimony against Malia.
   - We do **not** believe Malia.
   - Since we don't believe Malia, we dismiss her claim that Grace is lying.
   - Therefore, we revert to believing Grace.
   - Grace says Melanie is lying.
   - So, now we believe Melanie is lying.
   - We should **not** believe Melanie's statement about the dog being tired.

This pattern continues with each subsequent witness.

Following the same logic through all 20 witnesses:

- Every time an even-numbered witness accuses the previous witness of lying, and an odd-numbered witness accuses the accuser.
- Ultimately, **Gianna** (the 20th witness) has no one accusing her of lying.
- We believe Gianna, who says **Hattie** is lying.
- This chain of belief leads us to conclude that **Melanie is lying**.

**Therefore**, based on the provided statements and rules, **we should not believe that the dog is tired**.

Question: should it be believed that the dog is barking?
End your answer with: ""Answer: yes or no""","To determine whether we should believe that the dog is barking, let's analyze the chain of witnesses based on the rule: **Witnesses should be believed unless there is testimony that they are lying**.

We start with **Witness Zafira**, who says that the dog is barking. We will believe Zafira unless there's credible testimony that she is lying.

1. **Sable** says **Zafira is lying**.
   - We would believe Sable unless there's testimony that Sable is lying.
2. **Levi** says **Sable is lying**.
   - We believe Levi unless there's testimony that Levi is lying.
3. **Greer** says **Levi is lying**.
   - We believe Greer unless there's testimony that Greer is lying.

17. **Katherine** says **Skye is lying**.
18. **Scarlett** says **Katherine is lying**.
19. **Daxton** says **Scarlett is lying**.
20. **Summer** says **Daxton is lying**.

Now, we'll evaluate the credibility of each witness:

- **Summer** is the last witness and no one accuses her of lying. So, we **believe Summer**, who says **Daxton is lying**.
- Since Daxton is lying, we **do not believe Daxton**.
- Daxton accused **Scarlett** of lying, but because we don't believe Daxton, we **do believe Scarlett**.
- Scarlett says **Katherine is lying**, so we **do not believe Katherine**.
- Katherine accused **Skye**, but since we don't believe Katherine, we **do believe Skye**.
- Following this pattern, we continue:

  - **Believe** Skye ➔ **Kyla is lying** (don't believe Kyla)
  - **Don't believe** Kyla ➔ **Believe Amari**
  - **Believe** Amari ➔ **Zaila is lying** (don't believe Zaila)
  - **Don't believe** Zaila ➔ **Believe Reyna**
  - **Believe** Reyna ➔ **Aviana is lying** (don't believe Aviana)
  - **Don't believe** Aviana ➔ **Believe Sawyer**
  - **Believe** Sawyer ➔ **Harrison is lying** (don't believe Harrison)
  - **Don't believe** Harrison ➔ **Believe Dylan**
  - **Believe** Dylan ➔ **Everett is lying** (don't believe Everett)
  - **Don't believe** Everett ➔ **Believe Penelope**
  - **Believe** Penelope ➔ **Alayna is lying** (don't believe Alayna)
  - **Don't believe** Alayna ➔ **Believe Sarah**
  - **Believe** Sarah ➔ **Greer is lying** (don't believe Greer)
  - **Don't believe** Greer ➔ **Believe Levi**
  - **Believe** Levi ➔ **Sable is lying** (don't believe Sable)
  - **Don't believe** Sable ➔ **Believe Zafira**

Since we **believe Zafira**, who says **the dog is barking**, and there is no credible testimony from a trusted witness that she is lying, we should believe that the dog is barking.
