Witness Brooklyn says that the computer is on.
Witness Cora claims that witness Brooklyn lies.
Witness Brantley claims that witness Brooklyn lies.
Witness Carson claims that witness Brantley lies.
Question: is the computer on?
End your answer with: ""Answer: yes or no""","To solve this logic puzzle, we need to determine whether the computer is on based on the witnesses' statements and the provided policy: ""Witnesses should be believed unless there is testimony that they might lie.""

Let's analyze each witness:

1. **Brooklyn says**: ""The computer is on.""
   - No one accuses Brooklyn of lying except Cora and Brantley.

2. **Cora says**: ""Brooklyn lies.""
   - No one accuses Cora of lying.

3. **Brantley says**: ""Brooklyn lies.""
   - Carson accuses Brantley of lying.

4. **Carson says**: ""Brantley lies.""
   - No one accuses Carson of lying.

According to the policy, we believe witnesses unless there's testimony against them.

- **Carson is not accused of lying**, so we believe him. Therefore, **Brantley lies**.
- Since **Brantley lies** when he says ""Brooklyn lies,"" it means **Brooklyn tells the truth**.
- **Cora is not accused of lying**, but if we believe her statement that ""Brooklyn lies,"" it conflicts with our conclusion that **Brooklyn tells the truth**.

Given this contradiction, and since no one accuses **Cora** of lying, but believing her leads to inconsistency, the only logical resolution is that **Cora must be lying**.

Therefore:

- **Brooklyn tells the truth**: The computer is on.
- **Cora lies**: Incorrectly stating that Brooklyn lies.
- **Brantley lies**: As per Carson's truthful testimony.
- **Carson tells the truth**: Brantley lies.

Witness Emily claims that witness Liora lies.
Witness Samantha claims that witness Emily lies.
Witness Aubree claims that witness Samantha lies.
Question: is the food ready?
End your answer with: ""Answer: yes or no""","To determine whether the food is ready, let's analyze the statements step by step, keeping in mind the rule: **Witnesses should be believed unless there is testimony that they might lie.**

1. **Zanna says the food is ready.**
   - **Initially, we believe Zanna** because there's no testimony against her yet.

2. **Tenley claims that Zanna lies.**
   - **Now, we have testimony that Zanna might lie.**
   - **So, Zanna's statement is now questionable.**

3. **Liora claims that Tenley lies.**
   - **We have testimony that Tenley might lie.**
   - **But since Tenley might lie, perhaps Zanna is telling the truth after all.**
   - **However, we need to see if there's any testimony against Liora.**

4. **Emily claims that Liora lies.**
   - **Now, Liora might lie because we have testimony against her.**

5. **Samantha claims that Emily lies.**
   - **Emily might lie due to Samantha's testimony.**

6. **Aubree claims that Samantha lies.**
   - **Samantha might lie because of Aubree's statement.**

**At this point, Aubree is the last witness, and there's no testimony that Aubree might lie. So, we trust Aubree's statement.**

- **Since Aubree says Samantha lies, Samantha might lie.**
- **If Samantha might lie, her claim that Emily lies is questionable.**
- **Without credible testimony against Emily, we believe Emily.**
- **Emily says Liora lies, so Liora might lie.**
- **Since Liora might lie, her claim that Tenley lies is questionable.**
- **Without credible testimony against Tenley, we believe Tenley.**
- **Tenley says Zanna lies, so Zanna might lie.**
- **Since Zanna might lie, we cannot trust her statement that the food is ready.**

**Therefore, we cannot conclude that the food is ready based on Zanna's potentially untrustworthy claim.**

Witness Vivienne claims that witness Savannah lies.
Witness Madelyn claims that witness Jack lies.
Witness Nathan claims that witness Madelyn lies.
Question: is the grass wet?
End your answer with: ""Answer: yes or no""","To solve this puzzle, we need to analyze the statements and determine the credibility of each witness based on the given rule: witnesses should be believed unless there is testimony that they might lie.

1. **Witness Jack says that the grass is wet.**

2. **Witness Camille claims that witness Jack lies.**
   - No one accuses Camille of lying, so we believe her. Therefore, Jack is lying.

3. **Witness Savannah claims that witness Jack lies.**
   - **Witness Vivienne claims that witness Savannah lies.**
     - No one accuses Vivienne of lying, so we believe her. Therefore, Savannah is lying.
     - Since Savannah is lying about Jack lying, it means Jack is telling the truth.
     - This contradicts our earlier conclusion from Camille that Jack is lying.

4. **Witness Madelyn claims that witness Jack lies.**
   - **Witness Nathan claims that witness Madelyn lies.**
     - No one accuses Nathan of lying, so we believe him. Therefore, Madelyn is lying.
     - Since Madelyn is lying about Jack lying, it means Jack is telling the truth.
     - Again, this contradicts our conclusion from Camille.

We have a conflict:
- Camille, a credible witness, says Jack lies (implying the grass is not wet).
- Vivienne and Nathan, also credible witnesses, lead us to conclude that Jack tells the truth (implying the grass is wet).

In this scenario, when credible witnesses provide conflicting information, we must rely on the witness with the most direct testimony about the subject. Camille directly accuses Jack of lying without any intermediate steps, whereas the conclusions from Vivienne and Nathan require additional inferences through other witnesses who have been discredited.

Therefore, prioritizing the most direct and credible testimony:

- **Camille says Jack lies** ⇒ **Jack is lying** ⇒ **""The grass is wet"" is false** ⇒ **The grass is not wet**.

Question: is the grass green?
End your answer with: ""Answer: yes or no""","To determine whether the grass is green, let's analyze the witnesses' statements step by step, keeping in mind the rule: ""Witnesses should be believed unless there is testimony that they might lie.""

1. **Zaylee** says that the grass is green.
2. **Greer** claims that Zaylee lies. No one says Greer lies, so we believe Greer. Hence, Zaylee lies.
3. **Salvador** also claims that Zaylee lies. Josiah says Salvador lies, but let's see who to believe.
4. **Josiah** claims that Salvador lies. However, Caitlyn says Josiah lies.
5. **Caitlyn** claims that Josiah lies. Julian says Caitlyn lies.
6. **Julian** claims that Caitlyn lies. Emory says Julian lies.
7. **Emory** claims that Julian lies. No one says Emory lies, so we believe Emory. Therefore, Julian lies.
   
Since Julian lies about Caitlyn lying, Caitlyn is telling the truth when she says Josiah lies. Therefore, Josiah lies about Salvador lying. This means Salvador is telling the truth when he says Zaylee lies.

Since both Greer and Salvador say Zaylee lies—and we've determined they're truthful—we conclude that Zaylee lies when she says the grass is green.

4. **Liam** claims: *""Solara lies.""*
5. **Clover** claims: *""Liam lies.""*
6. **Kinsley** claims: *""Clover lies.""*
7. **Bruno** claims: *""Kinsley lies.""*

**Step-by-Step Analysis:**

- **Bruno** has no testimony against him, so we believe him. He says **Kinsley lies**.
- Since **Bruno** is truthful, **Kinsley** is lying. Therefore, **Kinsley's** claim that **Clover lies** is false.
- Since **Kinsley** lies about **Clover**, **Clover** is telling the truth. **Clover** says **Liam lies**.
- Since **Clover** is truthful, **Liam** is lying. Therefore, **Liam's** claim that **Solara lies** is false.
- However, both **Tessa** and **Hudson** claim that **Solara lies**, and there are no testimonies against them. So we believe **Tessa** and **Hudson**.
- Since there is testimony from reliable witnesses (**Tessa** and **Hudson**) that **Solara** lies, we cannot trust **Solara's** statement.

**Conclusion:**

There is reliable testimony that **Solara** lies, so we cannot believe her claim that the cat is meowing. No other trustworthy witness confirms that the cat is meowing.

3. **Peyton** claims that **Summer** lies.
4. **Trenton** claims that **Summer** lies.
5. **Arwen** claims that **Trenton** lies.
6. **Jaxson** claims that **Summer** lies.
7. **Jack** claims that **Jaxson** lies.

**Analysis:**

- **Summer:** Says the ocean is deep. No one says that Summer might lie (except those who might themselves be lying). Initially credible.

- **Tessa** and **Peyton:** Both claim that Summer lies. No one says that Tessa or Peyton might lie. Therefore, we must believe them. According to them, Summer is lying.

- **Trenton:** Claims that Summer lies. However, **Arwen** says that Trenton lies. No one accuses Arwen of lying, so we believe Arwen. Therefore, Trenton is lying about Summer lying, which implies that Summer is telling the truth (according to Trenton's statement being false).

- **Jaxson:** Claims that Summer lies. **Jack** says that Jaxson lies. No one says that Jack might lie, so we believe Jack. Therefore, Jaxson is lying about Summer lying, suggesting that Summer is telling the truth (from Jaxson's false statement).

**Conclusion:**

- **Witnesses against Summer:** Tessa and Peyton (both credible).
- **Witnesses in support of Summer:** The negation of Trenton and Jaxson's statements due to them lying does not provide direct testimony supporting Summer but negates some claims against her.

Despite Trenton and Jaxson being unreliable, we still have two credible witnesses (Tessa and Peyton) stating that Summer lies. No credible witnesses defend Summer directly.

**Therefore**, based on the credible testimonies:

- Summer is lying about the ocean being deep.
- So, the ocean is **not** deep.

**Step 1: Identify witnesses with no accusations against them.**
- **Olwen** and **Oakley** are not accused of lying by anyone. According to the rule, they are presumed to be telling the truth.

**Step 2: Determine the truthfulness of witnesses based on Olwen's statement.**
- **Olwen** says **Jaxson** lies. Since **Olwen** is telling the truth, **Jaxson** is lying.
- **Jaxson** (lying) claims that **Jeremiah** lies. Since **Jaxson** is lying, **Jeremiah** is telling the truth.
- **Jeremiah** (truthful) claims that **Isla** lies. Therefore, **Isla** is lying about the plane landing.

**Step 3: Determine the truthfulness of witnesses based on Oakley's statement.**
- **Oakley** says **Karina** lies. Since **Oakley** is telling the truth, **Karina** is lying.
- **Karina** (lying) claims that **Rayna** lies. Therefore, **Rayna** is telling the truth.
- **Rayna** (truthful) claims that **Isla** lies. This corroborates that **Isla** is lying.

Here's a step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Avani says:** ""The store is open.""

2. **Witnesses claiming Avani lies:** Maren, Jessamy, Saia, Aurora, and Emilia.

3. **Witnesses challenging others:**
   - **Cooper says:** Aurora lies.
   - **Ethan says:** Emilia lies.

4. **Determine who lies based on testimonies about lying:**
   - **Cooper says Aurora lies,** and no one says Cooper lies. Therefore, **Aurora is lying.**
   - **Ethan says Emilia lies,** and no one says Ethan lies. Therefore, **Emilia is lying.**

5. **Implications of Aurora and Emilia lying:**
   - **Aurora lies when she says Avani lies.** So, **Avani is telling the truth.**

Let's break down the statements:

1. **Zanna** says that the **bird is flying**.
2. **Saige** says that **Zanna lies**.
   - No one says Saige lies, so we believe Saige.
   - Therefore, **Zanna lies**.
   - So, the **bird is not flying** (since Zanna's statement is false).

3. **Bruno** says that **Zanna lies**.
4. **Emersyn** says that **Bruno lies**.
   - No one says Emersyn lies, so we believe Emersyn.
   - Therefore, **Bruno lies**.
   - So, Bruno's statement that Zanna lies is false, implying **Zanna tells the truth**.
   - This conflicts with our earlier conclusion that Zanna lies.

5. **Octavia** says that **Zanna lies**.
6. **Callen** says that **Octavia lies**.
7. **Mira** says that **Callen lies**.
8. **Thomas** says that **Mira lies**.
   - No one says Thomas lies, so we believe Thomas.
   - Therefore, **Mira lies**.
   - So, Callen tells the truth (since Mira's claim about him lying is false).
   - Therefore, **Octavia lies** (Callen's statement).
   - So, Octavia's claim that Zanna lies is false, implying **Zanna tells the truth**.
   - Again, this conflicts with our earlier conclusion.

**Conflict Resolution:**

- We have both evidence that Zanna lies (from Saige) and evidence that Zanna tells the truth (from the implications involving Bruno and Octavia).
- According to the rule, once there's testimony that someone might lie, their statements become unreliable.
- With conflicting testimonies and the presence of doubt, we cannot accept Zanna's statement as reliable.

**Conclusion:**

Since the only direct statement about the bird flying comes from Zanna, whose reliability is in question due to Saige's testimony, and no unquestionable evidence confirms that the bird is flying, we conclude that the bird is **not** flying.

2. Since **Sariyah lies**, her claim that **Isaiah lies** is false. Therefore, Isaiah tells the truth.

3. **Isaiah** says **Rina lies**, so Rina does lie.

4. Since **Rina lies**, her claim that **Camryn lies** is false. Therefore, Camryn tells the truth.

5. **Camryn**, whom we now know tells the truth, says that **Kamara lies**. Therefore, Kamara does lie.

6. **Hattie** is also unaccused by any other witness, so we believe Hattie. Hattie says **Skylar lies**, so Skylar does lie.

7. Since **Skylar lies**, her claim that **Kamara lies** is false. This would suggest that Kamara tells the truth.

However, we have a contradiction: **Camryn** (a truthful witness) says Kamara lies, and **Skylar** (a lying witness) also says Kamara lies (which would be a lie). Since witnesses are to be believed unless there is testimony that they might lie, and given that Camryn's untainted truthful testimony that Kamara lies conflicts with the conclusion from Skylar's testimony, we must accept the untainted witness's statement.

Therefore, despite the contradiction arising from Skylar's lie, the unequivocal, untainted, and truthful testimony from **Camryn** that **Kamara lies** leads us to conclude that Kamara lies about the floor being slippery.

Witness Asher claims that witness Avery lies.
Witness Zaylee claims that witness Asher lies.
Witness Sylvie claims that witness Zaylee lies.
Witness Leah claims that witness Sylvie lies.
Witness Lynx claims that witness Leah lies.
Witness Autumn claims that witness Lynx lies.
Question: is the lake frozen?
End your answer with: ""Answer: yes or no""","To determine whether the lake is frozen, let's analyze the witnesses and their credibility based on the provided facts and the rule that witnesses should be believed unless there is testimony that they might lie.

**Witness Statements and Testimonies:**

1. **Avery** says that the lake is frozen.
2. **Merrin** claims that Avery lies.
3. **Nia** claims that Avery lies.
4. **Asher** claims that Avery lies.
5. **Zaylee** claims that Asher lies.
6. **Sylvie** claims that Zaylee lies.
7. **Leah** claims that Sylvie lies.
8. **Lynx** claims that Leah lies.
9. **Autumn** claims that Lynx lies.

**Analysis of Witness Credibility:**

- **Credible Witnesses**: Witnesses with no testimony against them are considered credible. These are:
  - **Merrin**
  - **Nia**
  - **Autumn**

- **Witnesses Challenged by Credible Witnesses**:
  - **Avery** is claimed to lie by Merrin and Nia. Since Merrin and Nia are credible, Avery might lie.

- **Chain of Accusations**:
  - **Asher** is claimed to lie by **Zaylee**.
    - **Zaylee** is claimed to lie by **Sylvie**.
      - **Sylvie** is claimed to lie by **Leah**.
        - **Leah** is claimed to lie by **Lynx**.
          - **Lynx** is claimed to lie by **Autumn**.
  - Since **Autumn** is credible and claims that **Lynx** lies, **Lynx** might lie.
  - **Lynx** (who might lie) claims that **Leah** lies. But since **Lynx** might lie, we cannot trust this claim. Therefore, **Leah** remains credible.
  - **Leah** (credible) claims that **Sylvie** lies, so **Sylvie** might lie.
  - **Sylvie** (who might lie) claims that **Zaylee** lies. We cannot trust this claim, so **Zaylee** remains credible.
  - **Zaylee** (credible) claims that **Asher** lies, so **Asher** might lie.
  - **Asher** (who might lie) claimed that **Avery** lies. We cannot trust this claim due to **Asher**'s compromised credibility.
  
**Conclusion:**

- **Avery's Credibility**: Since credible witnesses **Merrin** and **Nia** claim that **Avery** lies, we cannot trust Avery's statement that the lake is frozen.
- **Evidence Regarding the Lake's Condition**: There are no credible witnesses affirming that the lake is frozen. The only statement supporting this is from **Avery**, whose credibility is compromised.
- **Logical Inference**: Given the lack of credible testimony claiming that the lake is frozen, and the credible accusations against **Avery**, we conclude that the lake is not frozen.

6. **Kamara** claims that **Alivia lies**.
7. **Henry** claims that **Alivia lies**.
8. **Wyatt** claims that **Alivia lies**.
9. **Stormy** claims that **Wyatt lies**.

**Analysis:**

- **Alivia**: Says the clock is ticking. However, seven witnesses accuse her of lying.
  
- **Inez, Mila, Callan, Brantley, Kamara, Henry**: Each claims that Alivia lies. No one accuses any of them of lying. Therefore, we **believe** them.

- **Wyatt**: Claims that Alivia lies. But **Stormy** (whom we believe, as no one accuses Stormy of lying) says that Wyatt lies. Therefore, Wyatt is lying about Alivia.

- Even without Wyatt's testimony, we have **six reliable witnesses** stating that Alivia lies. Thus, Alivia is lying about the clock ticking.

**Conclusion:**

Since multiple reliable witnesses state that **Alivia lies**, we conclude that Alivia is not telling the truth, and therefore, **the clock is not ticking**.

7. **Alayna** claims that Charlee lies.
8. **Micah** claims that Lachlan lies.
9. **Jovie** claims that Micah lies.

**Analysis:**

1. **Witness Credibility:**
   - **William, Meadow, Maxton, and Jayden** each claim that Lachlan lies, and there is no testimony stating that any of them might lie. Therefore, according to the rules, we must believe them.
   - **Charlee** claims that Lachlan lies, but **Alayna** says that Charlee lies. Since no one says that Alayna lies, we believe Alayna, which means Charlee is lying.
   - **Micah** claims that Lachlan lies, but **Jovie** says that Micah lies. Since no one says that Jovie lies, we believe Jovie, meaning Micah is lying.

2. **Implications:**
   - Since **Charlee** and **Micah** are lying when they say that Lachlan lies, their testimonies actually support the possibility that Lachlan is telling the truth.
   - However, the four trustworthy witnesses (**William, Meadow, Maxton, and Jayden**) unanimously state that Lachlan lies. Their credibility is unchallenged.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - With four credible witnesses stating that Lachlan lies and no credible witnesses supporting Lachlan's honesty (other than discredited ones), we conclude that Lachlan is lying.

1. **Witness Rhett says the room is clean.** We start by assuming Rhett is telling the truth unless shown otherwise.

2. **Witnesses accusing Rhett of lying:**
   - **Mackenzie:** Claims Rhett lies. No one accuses Mackenzie of lying, so we believe Mackenzie.
   - **Liza:** Claims Rhett lies. No one accuses Liza of lying, so we believe Liza.
   - **Alia:** Claims Rhett lies. However, **Samantha** says Alia lies. Since no one accuses Samantha of lying, we believe Samantha and conclude Alia might be lying. Therefore, we cannot trust Alia's statement.
   - **Cassius:** Claims Rhett lies. **Emmeline** says Cassius lies. **Brielle** accuses Emmeline of lying, but **Livia** says Brielle lies. Since no one accuses Livia of lying, we believe Livia, which means Brielle might be lying. This restores our trust in Emmeline, leading us to believe that Cassius might be lying. Therefore, we cannot trust Cassius's statement.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - Since Mackenzie and Liza, whom we trust, both say Rhett lies, we conclude that Rhett is indeed lying.

Question: is the sky blue?
End your answer with: ""Answer: yes or no""","The reasoning puzzle asks whether the sky is blue based on a series of witness statements. Witnesses are assumed to be telling the truth unless there is testimony suggesting they might lie.

Here's a summary of the witnesses and their statements:

1. **Juniper** says the sky is blue.
2. **Camille** claims that Juniper lies.
3. **Bria** claims that Juniper lies.
4. **Harmony** claims that Bria lies.
5. **Indigo** claims that Harmony lies.
6. **Juliet** claims that Juniper lies.
7. **Joshua** claims that Juliet lies.
8. **Renata** claims that Joshua lies.
9. **Sorrel** claims that Renata lies.

Let's determine who is telling the truth and who is lying.

Starting from the bottom:

- **Sorrel**: No one accuses Sorrel of lying, so Sorrel is telling the truth.
- **Renata**: Sorrel says Renata lies. Since Sorrel tells the truth, Renata is lying.
- **Joshua**: Renata (who is lying) says Joshua lies. Since Renata is lying, Joshua is telling the truth.
- **Juliet**: Joshua says Juliet lies. Since Joshua tells the truth, Juliet is lying.
- **Juniper**: Juliet (who is lying) says Juniper lies. Therefore, Juniper is telling the truth.
- **Camille**: No one accuses Camille of lying initially, so she is assumed truthful. But her statement contradicts the conclusion that Juniper tells the truth. This indicates a problem since we cannot have both Camille telling the truth (saying Juniper lies) and Juniper telling the truth.
  
However, **Bria**'s situation helps resolve this:

- **Harmony** says Bria lies.
- **Indigo** says Harmony lies.
- Since no one accuses Indigo of lying, Indigo tells the truth. Therefore, Harmony is lying, which means Bria is telling the truth.
- Bria says Juniper lies, but this contradicts our earlier conclusion that Juniper tells the truth.

This contradiction suggests that our initial assumption about Camille must be revisited. Since there's conflicting information and inability to consistently determine the truthfulness of Camille and Bria without contradiction, and considering Juniper has more support in being truthful, we conclude that **Juniper is telling the truth**.

1. **Tenley** says the computer is on.

2. **Noa** claims that **Tenley** lies.
   - No one says that **Noa** lies.
   - Therefore, **Noa** is telling the truth.
   - So, **Tenley** is lying about the computer being on.

3. **Cassius** claims that **Tenley** lies.
   - **Solara** says that **Cassius** lies.
   - No one says that **Solara** lies until **Ruby** claims **Solara** lies.

   - **Fiera** claims that **Audrey** lies.
   - No one says that **Fiera** lies.
   - Therefore, **Fiera** is telling the truth.
   - So, **Audrey** lies.

5. **Since** **Audrey** lies about **Oakley** lying, **Oakley** is telling the truth.
   - **Oakley** says **Orion** lies.
   - Therefore, **Orion** lies.

6. **Since** **Orion** lies about **Livia** lying, **Livia** is telling the truth.

- **Melody** (liar) says **Annabelle** lies ⇒ This is a lie ⇒ **Annabelle** tells the truth (but we've established **Annabelle** lies based on trusted witnesses).
- **Dalia** (liar) says **Annabelle** lies ⇒ This is a lie ⇒ **Annabelle** tells the truth (contradicts trusted witnesses).
- **Rosalie** (liar) says **Annabelle** lies ⇒ This is a lie ⇒ **Annabelle** tells the truth (contradicts trusted witnesses).

**Step 3: Resolve Contradictions**

Despite the contradictions from the untrusted witnesses, the statements from the trusted witnesses take precedence. Therefore, we maintain that **Annabelle** is lying.

Witness Ayla claims that witness Isaiah lies.
Witness Tanner claims that witness Isaiah lies.
Witness Mackenzie claims that witness Tanner lies.
Witness Greer claims that witness Isaiah lies.
Witness Micah claims that witness Greer lies.
Witness Zaniyah claims that witness Isaiah lies.
Witness Jeremiah claims that witness Zaniyah lies.
Witness Mia claims that witness Jeremiah lies.
Question: is the bed comfortable?
End your answer with: ""Answer: yes or no""","To determine whether the bed is comfortable, we need to assess the credibility of each witness based on the given testimonies and the rule that witnesses should be believed unless there is testimony that they might lie.

**1. Isaiah** says that the **bed is comfortable**.

**Witnesses claiming Isaiah lies:**
- **Gianna** claims that **Isaiah lies**.
- **Ayla** claims that **Isaiah lies**.
- **Tanner** claims that **Isaiah lies**.
- **Greer** claims that **Isaiah lies**.
- **Zaniyah** claims that **Isaiah lies**.

**Witnesses challenging those claims:**
- **Mackenzie** claims that **Tanner lies**.
- **Micah** claims that **Greer lies**.
- **Jeremiah** claims that **Zaniyah lies**.
- **Mia** claims that **Jeremiah lies**.

Now, let's evaluate each claim step-by-step:

1. **Gianna** and **Ayla** both say **Isaiah lies**. There is **no testimony suggesting Gianna or Ayla might lie**. Therefore, we **believe them**, and this suggests that **Isaiah is lying** about the bed being comfortable.

2. **Tanner** says **Isaiah lies**, but **Mackenzie** says **Tanner lies**. There is **no testimony against Mackenzie**, so we **believe Mackenzie**. This means **Tanner is lying**, so his claim that **Isaiah lies** is **false**. However, since other credible witnesses already indicate that **Isaiah lies**, this doesn't change our overall assessment.

3. **Greer** says **Isaiah lies**, but **Micah** says **Greer lies**. With no testimony against **Micah**, we **believe Micah**, meaning **Greer is lying**. So, **Greer's claim** that **Isaiah lies** is **false**. Again, the other credible testimonies still support that **Isaiah lies**.

4. **Zaniyah** says **Isaiah lies**. **Jeremiah** claims that **Zaniyah lies**, but **Mia** says **Jeremiah lies**. With no testimony against **Mia**, we **believe Mia**, meaning **Jeremiah is lying**. Therefore, **Jeremiah's claim** that **Zaniyah lies** is **false**, so **Zaniyah is telling the truth**. This further supports that **Isaiah lies**.

**Conclusion:**

- **Isaiah** is claimed to be lying by **Gianna**, **Ayla**, and **Zaniyah**, all of whom are credible based on the given information.
- There is **no credible evidence suggesting these three witnesses might lie**.
- Therefore, we **conclude that Isaiah is lying**, and thus the **bed is not comfortable**.

Question: is the food spicy?
End your answer with: ""Answer: yes or no""","To determine whether the food is spicy, let's analyze the statements step by step, considering that witnesses are to be believed unless there's testimony that they might lie.

1. **Kallie** says the food is spicy.
2. **Arden** claims that Kallie lies.
   - No one says Arden lies, so Arden is truthful. Therefore, Kallie might be lying.
3. **Kaliyah** claims that Kallie lies.
   - **Emersyn** claims that Kaliyah lies.
     - No one says Emersyn lies, so Emersyn is truthful. Therefore, Kaliyah lies.
   - Since Kaliyah lies about Kallie lying, Kallie may be truthful.
4. **Bria** claims that Kallie lies.
   - **Noemi** claims that Bria lies.
     - No one says Noemi lies, so Noemi is truthful. Therefore, Bria lies.
   - Since Bria lies about Kallie lying, Kallie may be truthful.
5. **Alaina** claims that Noemi lies.
   - **Kaylani** claims that Alaina lies.
     - No one says Kaylani lies, so Kaylani is truthful. Therefore, Alaina lies.
   - Since Alaina lies about Noemi lying, Noemi is truthful.
6. **Harrison** claims that Kaylani lies.
   - **Adley** claims that Harrison lies.
     - No one says Adley lies, so Adley is truthful. Therefore, Harrison lies.
   - Since Harrison lies about Kaylani lying, Kaylani is truthful.

From the above:

- Kaliyah and Bria lie about Kallie lying.
- Kaylani and Noemi are truthful.
- Since Arden is truthful and says Kallie lies, and Kaliyah and Bria (who lie) also say Kallie lies, the balance of truthful testimonies suggests that Kallie might be lying.

However, since Emersyn, Noemi, Kaylani, and Adley are truthful and their testimonies ultimately support Kallie being truthful, we conclude that Kallie tells the truth.

1. **Taliah** says the dinner is burnt.
   - **Alaina** says that **Taliah** lies.
     - No one claims that **Alaina** lies.
     - Therefore, **Alaina** is credible, and **Taliah** might be lying.
   - **Aidan** also says that **Taliah** lies.
     - **Elijah** says that **Aidan** lies.
       - **Dalia** says that **Elijah** lies.
         - **Liora** says that **Dalia** lies.

     - **Norah** says that **Ella** lies.
       - **Kennedy** says that **Norah** lies.

           - This restores **Norah**'s credibility, making **Ella** possibly a liar.
     - Since **Ella** might lie, her accusation against **Taliah** is not reliable.

Since **Alaina** is the only credible witness accusing **Taliah** of lying, and no one disputes **Alaina**'s credibility, we consider **Taliah** as possibly lying about the dinner being burnt.

1. **Witnesses are to be believed unless there is testimony that they might lie.**
2. **Witnesses claimed to be lying are Saphira, Aurora, Quincy, Zafira, Sariyah, Jordan, and Noa.**

Let's examine the chain of testimonies:

- **Saphira** says the food is spicy.
- **Aurora** says that **Saphira** lies.
- **Kenna** says that **Aurora** lies.
  - Since no one says **Kenna** lies, we believe her.
  - Thus, **Aurora** is lying, so **Saphira** tells the truth.

- **Quincy** says that **Saphira** lies.
- **Zafira** says that **Quincy** lies.
- **Arden** says that **Zafira** lies.
  - Since no one says **Arden** lies, we believe her.
  - Thus, **Zafira** is lying, so **Quincy** tells the truth.

- **Sariyah** says that **Saphira** lies.
- **Jordan** says that **Sariyah** lies.
- **Noa** says that **Jordan** lies.
- **Everett** says that **Noa** lies.
  - Since no one says **Everett** lies, we believe him.
  - Thus, **Noa** is lying, so **Jordan** tells the truth.
  - **Jordan** claims **Sariyah** is lying, so **Sariyah** is lying.
  - Therefore, **Saphira** tells the truth.

We have conflicting testimonies about **Saphira** from two unchallenged witnesses (**Kenna** and **Arden**). However, assuming **Saphira** tells the truth results in only one unchallenged witness (**Arden**) being a liar. Assuming **Saphira** lies would mean two unchallenged witnesses (**Kenna** and **Everett**) are liars, which contradicts the rules.

Therefore, the most consistent conclusion is that **Saphira** tells the truth.

1. **Carson** says that the sky is blue.
2. **Zaniyah** claims that Carson lies. There is no testimony against Zaniyah, so we believe her. Therefore, Carson might be lying.
3. **Katherine** also claims that Carson lies. There is no testimony against Katherine (since Madison, who says Katherine lies, might herself be lying—explained below), so we believe her too. This reinforces that Carson might be lying.
4. **Madison** claims that Katherine lies. However, **Veda** claims that Madison lies.
5. **Veda** claims that Madison lies. There is no uncontradicted testimony against Veda, so we believe her. Therefore, Madison might be lying.

**Conclusion:**

- We have credible testimony from both Zaniyah and Katherine that Carson lies.
- There is no credible testimony discrediting Zaniyah or Katherine.
- Therefore, Carson might be lying about the sky being blue.
- According to the rule, since Carson might lie, we cannot trust his statement.

1. **Emmeline** says the pencil is sharp.

2. **Maren, Max, Holden, Oaklee, Azaria, and Mia** claim that **Emmeline lies**. No one disputes the honesty of Maren, Max, Holden, Oaklee, or Azaria. Therefore, we must believe them when they say Emmeline lies.

1. **Initial Statement**:
   - **Jaxson** says the homework is difficult.

2. **Witnesses Claiming Jaxson Lies**:
   - **Zaiden**, **Isla**, **Aidan**, **Rosalie**, **Greyson**, **Lily**, and **Genesis** claim that Jaxson lies.
   
   We have **6 witnesses (excluding Genesis for now)** stating that Jaxson lies, and there is **no testimony that these witnesses lie**. Therefore, we should believe them, and conclude that **Jaxson lies**.

3. **Analyzing Genesis and Josephine**:
   - **Genesis** says Jaxson lies (which supports our conclusion).
   - **Josephine** claims that Genesis lies.
   
   Since no one claims that Josephine lies (except for Janiah, whom we'll analyze next), we believe Josephine and conclude that **Genesis lies**.

4. **Understanding the Implication**:
   - Since Genesis lies about Jaxson lying, it would suggest that **Jaxson tells the truth**. However, this contradicts our earlier conclusion supported by the other 6 witnesses.
   - Given that the majority (6 witnesses) unchallengedly claim Jaxson lies, and only Genesis's credibility is undermined by Josephine, we accept that **Jaxson lies** and Genesis's lie doesn't change that.

5. **Evaluating Janiah and Leonardo**:
   - **Janiah** says Josephine lies.
   - **Leonardo** says Janiah lies.
   
   No one claims Leonardo lies, so we believe Leonardo, leading us to conclude that **Janiah lies**. Therefore, Josephine tells the truth (which we've already considered).

End your answer with: ""Answer: yes or no""","To determine whether the road is long, we need to analyze the witnesses' testimonies using the given rule: **Witnesses should be believed unless there is testimony that they might lie.**

**Summary of Testimonies:**

1. **Davina** says: *""The road is long.""*
2. **Roslyn** says: *""Davina lies.""*
3. **Rowan** says: *""Davina lies.""*
4. **Amayah** says: *""Davina lies.""*
5. **Monroe** says: *""Davina lies.""*
6. **Lian** says: *""Davina lies.""*
7. **Sariah** says: *""Davina lies.""*
8. **Astrid** says: *""Davina lies.""*
9. **Merrin** says: *""Davina lies.""*
10. **Kailani** says: *""Davina lies.""*
11. **Leena** says: *""Kailani lies.""*

**Analysis:**

- **Leena's Testimony:** Since there's no testimony against Leena, we believe her when she says that **Kailani lies**.
  - Therefore, **Kailani's statement** that *""Davina lies""* is false.
  - So, according to Kailani (who lies), **Davina tells the truth**.
  
- **Other Witnesses Against Davina:**
  - **Roslyn, Rowan, Amayah, Monroe, Lian, Sariah, Astrid,** and **Merrin** all say that **Davina lies**.
  - There is **no testimony against these witnesses**, so we must believe them.

**Conflict Resolution:**

- Despite **Kailani's** discredited testimony, we have **eight other credible witnesses** stating that **Davina lies**.
- **Davina** says the road is long, but **credible witnesses** claim she lies.
- **Conclusion:** Davina is lying when she says *""The road is long.""*

Question: is the water boiling?
End your answer with: ""Answer: yes or no""","To determine whether the water is boiling, let's analyze the witnesses' statements step by step, following the instruction that ""Witnesses should be believed unless there is testimony that they might lie.""

1. **Noa** says the water is boiling.

2. **Rina**, **Callen**, **Melanie**, **Taliah**, **Alia**, **Bria**, **Roslyn**, and **Robert** all claim that **Noa** lies.

3. **Karina** claims that **Roslyn** lies.

4. **Colton** claims that **Robert** lies.

**Analysis:**

- Since there's no testimony against **Rina**, **Callen**, **Melanie**, **Taliah**, **Alia**, and **Bria**, we accept their statements that **Noa** lies.

- **Karina** says **Roslyn** lies. There's no testimony against **Karina**, so we accept that **Roslyn** is lying. Therefore, **Roslyn**'s claim that **Noa** lies is false, which implies **Noa** tells the truth. However, this conflicts with the six other witnesses who say **Noa** lies.

- **Colton** says **Robert** lies. There's no testimony against **Colton**, so we accept that **Robert** is lying. Therefore, **Robert**'s claim that **Noa** lies is false, suggesting **Noa** tells the truth. Again, this conflicts with the six other witnesses.

Given that the majority of the witnesses (whose honesty is unimpeached) claim that **Noa** lies, and only **Karina** and **Colton** provide conflicting testimony against **Roslyn** and **Robert**, we conclude:

- **Noa** is lying about the water boiling.

Question: is the beach crowded?
End your answer with: ""Answer: yes or no""","To determine whether the beach is crowded, we analyze the witnesses' statements based on the principle that witnesses are to be believed unless there is testimony that they might lie.

1. **Kai** says the beach is crowded.
2. **Matthew**, **Zanna**, **Sienna**, **Hattie**, **Inez**, and **Rhea** all claim that **Kai** lies.
   - There is no testimony suggesting that any of these witnesses might lie.
   - Therefore, we accept their statements as truth: **Kai** lies.

3. **Arabella** also claims that **Kai** lies.
4. **Sariyah** claims that **Arabella** lies.
   - There is no testimony suggesting that **Sariyah** might lie.
   - Therefore, **Arabella** lies.
   - Since **Arabella** lies when she says **Kai** lies, this would imply that **Kai** tells the truth.
   - However, multiple honest witnesses (from point 2) indicate that **Kai** lies, so despite **Arabella**’s dishonesty, we have sufficient evidence that **Kai** lies.

5. **Caleb** claims that **Rhea** lies.
6. **Angela** claims that **Caleb** lies.
   - There is no testimony suggesting that **Angela** might lie.
   - Therefore, **Caleb** lies.
   - Since **Caleb** lies when he says **Rhea** lies, this means **Rhea** tells the truth.
   - **Rhea** (from point 2) confirms that **Kai** lies.

Given that multiple trustworthy witnesses assert that **Kai** lies, and there is no testimony against their honesty, we conclude that **Kai** is lying when he says the beach is crowded. Therefore, the beach is not crowded.

Question: is the car fast?
End your answer with: ""Answer: yes or no""","To determine whether the car is fast, we need to assess the credibility of the witnesses based on the given rules:

1. **Witnesses are to be believed unless there is testimony that they might lie.**

Let's list the witnesses and see who has been accused of lying:

- **Camille:** Claims the car is fast. *Accused of lying by Greyson, Christian, Lyla, Mary, Avery, Azura, and Victoria.*
- **Greyson:** Claims Camille lies. *No one accuses Greyson of lying.*
- **Christian:** Claims Camille lies. *No one accuses Christian of lying.*
- **Lyla:** Claims Camille lies. *No one accuses Lyla of lying.*
- **Mary:** Claims Camille lies. *No one accuses Mary of lying.*
- **Avery:** Claims Camille lies. *Accused of lying by Brooklyn.*
- **Azura:** Claims Camille lies. *Accused of lying by Melanie.*
- **Victoria:** Claims Camille lies. *Accused of lying by Adalyn.*
- **Brooklyn:** Claims Avery lies. *No one accuses Brooklyn of lying.*
- **Melanie:** Claims Azura lies. *No one accuses Melanie of lying.*
- **Adalyn:** Claims Victoria lies. *No one accuses Adalyn of lying.*

**Credible Witnesses (No one says they might lie):**

- Greyson
- Christian
- Lyla
- Mary
- Brooklyn
- Melanie
- Adalyn

**Witnesses with Doubt (Someone says they might lie):**

- Camille
- Avery
- Azura
- Victoria

**Analysis:**

- **Camille's credibility is compromised** because multiple credible witnesses (Greyson, Christian, Lyla, and Mary) state that she lies.
- **Avery's, Azura's, and Victoria's statements are also compromised** due to credible witnesses (Brooklyn, Melanie, and Adalyn respectively) claiming they lie.
- **No credible witness supports Camille's claim** that the car is fast.

**Conclusion:**

Given that credible witnesses claim that Camille lies, and there is no credible evidence to support her statement, we conclude that the car is not fast.

Question: is the air humid?
End your answer with: ""Answer: yes or no""","To determine whether the air is humid, let's analyze the witnesses and their credibility based on the given rules:

1. **Norah** says: *""The air is humid.""*

   - **Accusers of Norah**: Octavia, Angel, Elaine, Briar.
   - Witnesses are to be believed unless someone testifies they might lie.
   - Therefore, if credible witnesses accuse Norah of lying, we should doubt her statement.

2. **Octavia** says: *""Norah lies.""*
   - No one accuses Octavia of lying.
   - Therefore, Octavia is a credible witness.

3. **Angel** says: *""Norah lies.""*
   - No one accuses Angel of lying.
   - Therefore, Angel is a credible witness.

4. **Elaine** says: *""Norah lies.""*
   - **Kaiya** says: *""Elaine lies.""*
   - Kaiya is not accused by anyone.
   - Therefore, Elaine's credibility is questionable.

5. **Briar** says: *""Norah lies.""*
   - **Noa** says: *""Briar lies.""*
   - **Nyah** says: *""Noa lies.""*
   - **Santiago** says: *""Nyah lies.""*
   - **Callie** says: *""Santiago lies.""*
   - **Zuri** says: *""Callie lies.""*
   - Each accuser is themselves accused, creating a chain of doubt.
   - Since this chain doesn't affect **Octavia** and **Angel**, their testimonies remain credible.

**Conclusion**:

- **Norah** is accused by credible witnesses (**Octavia** and **Angel**).
- Therefore, we conclude that **Norah is lying**.
- If Norah lies about the air being humid, it means **the air is not humid**.

**Rule:** Witnesses should be believed unless there is testimony that they might lie.

**Witness Statements:**

1. **Stella** says that the door is locked.
2. **Zalia** claims that witness Stella lies.
3. **Bella** claims that witness Stella lies.

8. **Callan** claims that witness Stella lies.
9. **Amayah** claims that witness Callan lies.
10. **Levi** claims that witness Amayah lies.
11. **Paisley** claims that witness Levi lies.

**Step-by-Step Analysis:**

1. **Identify Witnesses with No Accusations Against Them:**

   - **Zalia**
   - **Bella**
   - **Liam**
   - **Maelyn**
   - **Paisley**

   These witnesses have no testimony against them suggesting they might lie. Therefore, we **believe** them.

2. **Evaluate Accused Witnesses:**

   - **Stella** is accused of lying by **Zalia** and **Bella** (both trustworthy). Therefore, Stella **might lie**, and we cannot believe her statement that the door is locked.
   - **Joseph** is accused of lying by **Liam** (trustworthy). Therefore, Joseph **might lie**, and we cannot believe his statements.
   - **Thomas** is accused of lying by **Maelyn** (trustworthy). Therefore, Thomas **might lie**, and we cannot believe his statements.
   - **Callan** is accused of lying by **Amayah**.
     - **Amayah** is only accused by **Levi**, who is accused of lying by **Paisley** (trustworthy). Hence, **Levi might lie**, making **Amayah** trustworthy.
     - Since **Amayah** is trustworthy, **Callan** **might lie**.
   - **Levi** is accused of lying by **Paisley** (trustworthy). Therefore, **Levi might lie**.

3. **Determine the Status of the Door:**

   - **Stella's** claim that the door is locked cannot be trusted because she might lie.
   - No trustworthy witness claims that the door is unlocked.
   - However, without a trustworthy statement confirming that the door is locked, we cannot conclude that it is locked.

**Conclusion:**

Since there's no credible evidence to confirm that the door is locked and Stella's statement cannot be trusted, we conclude that the door is **not** locked.

**Analysis:**

1. **Penelope** makes a statement about the day. She is believed unless there is testimony that she might lie.

2. **Sebastian** and **Kamara** both claim that Penelope lies. Neither Sebastian nor Kamara is accused of lying by anyone. Therefore, according to the instruction, we should believe them.

3. **Fiera** also claims that Penelope lies, but **Brielle** (not accused by anyone) says that Fiera lies. Therefore, Fiera's claim is not reliable.

4. **Audrey** claims that Penelope lies, but **Melanie** (not accused by anyone) says that Audrey lies. Therefore, Audrey's claim is not reliable.

5. **Kyson** claims that Penelope lies, but **William** (not accused by anyone) says that Kyson lies. Therefore, Kyson's claim is not reliable.

3. **Witness Yara** also claims that Arwen lies, but **Witness Robert** (unchallenged) says that Yara lies, so we cannot trust Yara's testimony.
4. **Witness Solara** claims that Kyson lies, but **Witness Kennedy** (unchallenged) says that Solara lies. Therefore, Solara's claim is unreliable, and Kyson's credibility remains intact.
5. **Witness Arlo** claims that Colette lies, but **Witness Hazel** (unchallenged) says that Arlo lies. So, Colette's credibility is unaffected.

Since four unchallenged witnesses (Sadira, Sofia, Kyson, and Colette) say that Arwen lies, we have sufficient reason to doubt Arwen's claim. No reliable witness supports Arwen's statement or provides evidence that the road is long.

   - Therefore, we believe **Beckham**.
4. **Laila** says **John lies**.
   - **Juniper** says **Laila lies**.
     - **Grayson** says **Juniper lies**.
       - **Tahlia** says **Grayson lies**.
         - **Naomi** says **Tahlia lies**.
           - **Layna** says **Naomi lies**.
             - *No one says Layna lies*, so we believe her.
           - Therefore, **Naomi** is lying about **Tahlia**, so **Tahlia** tells the truth.
         - Therefore, **Grayson** is lying about **Juniper**, so **Juniper** tells the truth.
       - Therefore, **Laila** is lying about **John**.
5. Since **Laila** is lying about **John**, her statement that **John lies** is false, so **John** tells the truth.

**Step 2: Resolve the Contradiction**

We have:
- **Emily** and **Beckham** (both credible) say **John lies**.
- **Laila** (discredited) says **John lies**, but we have proven she lies.
- **John** is claimed to be both a liar and truthful.

**Conclusion:**

Despite the contradiction from **Laila's** discredited claim, we have two credible witnesses (**Emily** and **Beckham**) stating that **John lies**, and only one witness (**Juniper**, through a longer chain) suggesting **John** tells the truth.

Given that more credible witnesses say **John lies**, we conclude that **John is lying**, and therefore, **the cat is not meowing**.

Question: are the lights bright?
End your answer with: ""Answer: yes or no""","To determine whether the lights are bright, let's analyze the witnesses' statements step by step, following the rule that witnesses should be believed unless there is testimony that they might lie.

1. **Zaila** says that **the lights are bright**.

2. **Kyrah** claims that **Zaila lies**.
   - No one claims that Kyrah lies.
   - Therefore, we believe Kyrah.
   - Thus, Zaila is lying about the lights being bright.

3. **Carson** claims that **Zaila lies**.
   - **Caitlyn** claims that **Carson lies**.
     - **Sebastian** claims that **Caitlyn lies**.
       - **Amelia** claims that **Sebastian lies**.
         - No one claims that Amelia lies.
         - Therefore, we believe Amelia.
         - Thus, Sebastian is lying when he says Caitlyn lies.
       - Therefore, Caitlyn does not lie.
     - Therefore, we believe Caitlyn.
     - Thus, Carson is lying about Zaila lying.
   - Therefore, Carson lies, and Zaila does not lie according to this chain.

4. **Ellie** claims that **Zaila lies**.
   - **Maelyn** claims that **Ellie lies**.
     - **Aidan** claims that **Maelyn lies**.
       - **Ramiro** claims that **Aidan lies**.
         - **Marlee** claims that **Ramiro lies**.
           - No one claims that Marlee lies.
           - Therefore, we believe Marlee.
           - Thus, Ramiro is lying when he says Aidan lies.
         - Therefore, Aidan does not lie.
       - Therefore, we believe Aidan.
       - Thus, Maelyn is lying when she says Ellie lies.
     - Therefore, Ellie does not lie.
   - Therefore, we believe Ellie.
   - Thus, Zaila is lying about the lights being bright.

**Conclusion:**

- Kyrah and Ellie both claim that Zaila lies, and no one claims that Kyrah or Ellie lies.
- Carson's claim that Zaila lies is invalidated because we found that Carson lies.
- Given the credible testimonies of Kyrah and Ellie, we conclude that Zaila is lying.
- Since Zaila lies when she says the lights are bright, the lights are not bright.

Witness Ashlynn claims that witness Willow lies.
Witness Eviana claims that witness Ashlynn lies.
Witness Christopher claims that witness Eviana lies.
Question: are the lights bright?
End your answer with: ""Answer: yes or no""","To solve this reasoning puzzle, we need to determine whether the lights are bright based on the testimonies of the witnesses. The key rule is: **Witnesses should be believed unless there is testimony that they might lie**.

Let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Davina says that the lights are bright.**
   - Is there any testimony that Davina might lie?
     - **Yes**, Evan claims that Davina lies.

2. **Evan claims that Davina lies.**
   - Is there any testimony that Evan might lie?
     - **Yes**, Camille claims that Evan lies.

3. **Camille claims that Evan lies.**
   - Is there any testimony that Camille might lie?
     - **Yes**, Mackenzie claims that Camille lies.

4. **Mackenzie claims that Camille lies.**
   - Is there any testimony that Mackenzie might lie?
     - **No**, so we believe Mackenzie.

Since we believe Mackenzie (step 4), who says that **Camille lies**, it means Camille's statement is false. Therefore:
- **Camille lies** (her claim that Evan lies is false).
- Therefore, **Evan tells the truth** (since Camille lied about him).

Since Evan tells the truth (step 2), and he claims that **Davina lies**, it means Davina's statement is false. Therefore:
- **Davina lies** (the lights are not bright).

Now, let's consider the second chain involving other witnesses:

5. **Greer claims that Davina lies.**
   - Is there any testimony that Greer might lie?
     - **Yes**, Jaxon claims that Greer lies.

6. **Jaxon claims that Greer lies.**
   - Is there any testimony that Jaxon might lie?
     - **Yes**, Luke claims that Jaxon lies.

7. **Luke claims that Jaxon lies.**
   - Is there any testimony that Luke might lie?
     - **Yes**, Willow claims that Luke lies.

8. **Willow claims that Luke lies.**
   - Is there any testimony that Willow might lie?
     - **Yes**, Ashlynn claims that Willow lies.

9. **Ashlynn claims that Willow lies.**
   - Is there any testimony that Ashlynn might lie?
     - **Yes**, Eviana claims that Ashlynn lies.

10. **Eviana claims that Ashlynn lies.**
    - Is there any testimony that Eviana might lie?
      - **Yes**, Christopher claims that Eviana lies.

11. **Christopher claims that Eviana lies.**
    - Is there any testimony that Christopher might lie?
      - **No**, so we believe Christopher.

Since we believe Christopher (step 11), who says that **Eviana lies**, it means Eviana's statement is false. Therefore:
- **Eviana lies** (her claim that Ashlynn lies is false).
- Therefore, **Ashlynn tells the truth**.

Since Ashlynn tells the truth (step 9), and she claims that **Willow lies**, it means Willow's statement is false. Therefore:
- **Willow lies** (her claim that Luke lies is false).
- Therefore, **Luke tells the truth**.

Since Luke tells the truth (step 7), and he claims that **Jaxon lies**, it means Jaxon's statement is false. Therefore:
- **Jaxon lies** (his claim that Greer lies is false).
- Therefore, **Greer tells the truth**.

Since Greer tells the truth (step 5), and he claims that **Davina lies**, this confirms that Davina's statement is false.

**Conclusion**: Both reasoning chains conclude that Davina lies about the lights being bright.

1. **Calia** says the chocolate is melting.
2. **Lucian** claims that Calia lies.
   - No credible testimony suggests Lucian might lie (Layne's testimony is later invalidated).
   - Therefore, we believe Lucian.
3. **Layne** claims that Lucian lies.
   - **Penelope** claims that Layne lies.
   - Since Penelope is credible (no testimony against her), Layne might lie.
   - We cannot believe Layne.
4. **Penelope** is credible.
5. **Zaylee** claims Penelope lies.
   - **Veda** claims Zaylee lies.

1. **Annabelle** says that the teacher is speaking.

2. **Azalea**, **Cassie**, **Elira**, **Cooper**, **Addison**, and **Anwen** all claim that **Annabelle** lies.

   - **No one** claims that these six witnesses (Azalea, Cassie, Elira, Cooper, Addison, Anwen) might lie.

First, let's identify which witnesses have been accused of lying:

- **Dalia** (accused by Alana, Lily, Kaiya, Brooks, Gracie, Madelyn, Zafira, Kassidy, Mackayla)
- **Kassidy** (accused by Landon)
- **Mackayla** (accused by Leoni)

Now, let's proceed step by step:

1. **Witnesses without accusations**: Alana, Lily, Kaiya, Brooks, Gracie, Madelyn, Zafira, Landon, and Leoni have not been accused of lying. Therefore, we should believe their testimonies.

2. **Witnesses accused of lying**: Dalia, Kassidy, and Mackayla have been accused of lying. Therefore, there is reason to doubt their testimonies.

3. **An important note**: Kassidy and Mackayla accuse Dalia of lying, but since they themselves are accused of lying, their testimonies against Dalia are questionable.

4. **Consolidating trustworthy testimonies**:
   - **Alana**, **Lily**, **Kaiya**, **Brooks**, **Gracie**, **Madelyn**, and **Zafira** all claim that **Dalia lies**.
   - These seven witnesses are unaccused and thus are deemed truthful.

5. **Conclusion about Dalia**: Since seven trustworthy witnesses state that Dalia lies, we conclude that Dalia is lying when she says the clock is fast.

**Step 2: Evaluate the Trustworthiness of Accusing Witnesses**

According to the rule, we should believe witnesses unless another witness claims they might lie.

- **Calia (7)** is accused by **Sebastian (8)** of lying.
  - Therefore, **Calia** is lying, so her claim that Kinley lies is false.
- **Zane (9)** is accused by **Tinsley (10)** of lying.
  - Therefore, **Zane** is lying, so his claim that Kinley lies is false.
- **Saffron (11)** is accused by **Jovan (12)** of lying.

- **Janiyah (2)**
- **Stella (3)**
- **John (4)**
- **Landon (5)**
- **Alice (6)**

Since no one accuses these witnesses of lying, we accept their testimonies as truthful.

  - **Alia** is accused by **Linnea**.
  - **Jenevieve** is accused by **Mila**.

**Determining Trustworthy Witnesses:**

- **Marlee**, **Davina**, **Savannah**, **Leah**, **Linnea**, **Mila**, and **Ella** are trustworthy because no one accuses them of lying.

**Evaluating the Statements:**

1. **Layne says the stars are shining**, but is accused by trustworthy witnesses (**Marlee**, **Davina**, **Savannah**, **Leah**, and **Odalys**). Therefore, Layne **lies**, and the stars are **not** shining.

2. **Alia** claims **Layne lies**, but is accused by trustworthy **Linnea**. Therefore, **Alia lies**, so **Layne tells the truth** according to Alia's testimony. However, Layne is already determined to be lying based on earlier trustworthy testimonies.

3. **Jenevieve** claims **Layne lies**, but is accused by trustworthy **Mila**. Therefore, **Jenevieve lies**, so **Layne tells the truth** according to Jenevieve's testimony. But again, Layne is already determined to be lying.

4. **Odalys** claims **Layne lies** and is accused by **Fiera**, who is in turn accused by trustworthy **Ella**. Since **Fiera lies** (according to Ella), **Odalys is trustworthy**. This supports that **Layne lies**.

**Conclusion:**

The majority of trustworthy witnesses (**Marlee**, **Davina**, **Savannah**, **Leah**, and **Odalys**) claim that **Layne lies**. There are no trustworthy witnesses providing evidence that the stars are shining. Therefore, we conclude that **the stars are not shining**.

End your answer with: ""Answer: yes or no""","To solve this puzzle, we need to determine whether Zinnia is telling the truth when she says ""the door is locked,"" based on the testimonies provided and the rule that witnesses should be believed unless there is testimony that they might lie.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Zinnia says the door is locked.** We are to believe her unless there is testimony that she might lie.
   
2. **Isla, Connor, and Jayden each claim that Zinnia lies.** Since no one testifies that any of them lies, we should believe their statements. This suggests that Zinnia is lying.

3. **Stella also claims that Zinnia lies.** However, **Aurora claims that Stella lies.** Since no one says that Aurora lies, we believe Aurora, which means Stella is lying. Therefore, Stella's claim that Zinnia lies is false, so Stella cannot be used to conclude that Zinnia is lying.

4. **Christian claims that Zinnia lies.** **Inez claims that Christian lies.** Since no one testifies that Inez lies, we believe Inez, which means Christian is lying. Therefore, Christian's claim that Zinnia lies is false, so Christian cannot be used to conclude that Zinnia is lying.

5. **Jolene claims that Inez lies.** **Maeve claims that Jolene lies.** **Monroe claims that Maeve lies.** **Holly claims that Monroe lies.** Since no one testifies that Holly lies, we believe Holly, which means Monroe is lying. Therefore, Maeve is telling the truth (since Monroe lied about her), so Jolene is lying (since Maeve said Jolene lies), and thus Inez is telling the truth (since Jolene lied about Inez).

6. Based on the above, only Isla, Connor, and Jayden's testimonies remain credible in asserting that Zinnia lies. Since there's no testimony against them, we must accept that Zinnia is lying.

End your answer with: ""Answer: yes or no""","To determine whether the park is quiet, we need to assess the credibility of the witnesses based on the given rules: witnesses are to be believed unless there is testimony that they might lie.

**Witness Statements:**

1. **Quincy** says the park is quiet.
2. **Lennox** claims that Quincy lies.
3. **Isaac** claims that Quincy lies.
4. **Penelope** claims that Quincy lies.
5. **Tinsley** claims that Quincy lies.
6. **Victoria** claims that Tinsley lies.
7. **Aviana** claims that Quincy lies.
8. **Briar** claims that Aviana lies.
9. **Adira** claims that Quincy lies.
10. **Mariah** claims that Adira lies.
11. **Sariah** claims that Quincy lies.
12. **Taliah** claims that Sariah lies.

**Analysis:**

- **Witnesses Claiming Quincy Lies:** Lennox, Isaac, Penelope, Tinsley, Aviana, Adira, Sariah.
  
- **Challenges to Their Credibility:**
    - **Tinsley** is claimed to lie by Victoria.
    - **Aviana** is claimed to lie by Briar.
    - **Adira** is claimed to lie by Mariah.
    - **Sariah** is claimed to lie by Taliah.

- **Witnesses Unchallenged (Credible):**
    - **Lennox**
    - **Isaac**
    - **Penelope**

**Conclusion:**

- Since **Lennox**, **Isaac**, and **Penelope** are credible (no one claims they might lie), and they all say that **Quincy lies**, we must accept their testimonies.
- Therefore, **Quincy is lying** about the park being quiet.
- As a result, **the park is not quiet**.

Question: is the bag heavy?
End your answer with: ""Answer: yes or no""","To determine if the bag is heavy, we need to assess the credibility of the witnesses based on the provided rules: witnesses should be believed unless there is testimony that they might lie.

1. **Eloise** says the bag is heavy.
2. **Chloe**, **Astrid**, **Genesis**, **Alia**, and **Kendra** claim that **Eloise** lies.
   - No one claims that **Chloe**, **Astrid**, or **Genesis** lie, so we believe them. They confirm that **Eloise** lies.
   - **Abigail** claims **Alia** lies, but **Charlie** says **Abigail** lies. Since no one accuses **Charlie** of lying, we believe **Charlie** and conclude **Abigail** lies, which means **Alia** is truthful in saying **Eloise** lies.
   - **Aidan** claims **Kendra** lies, but **Skylar** says **Aidan** lies. **Brinley** claims **Skylar** lies, but **Kaylee** says **Brinley** lies. No one accuses **Kaylee** of lying, so we believe her and conclude **Brinley** lies, meaning **Skylar** is truthful, and thus **Aidan** lies. Therefore, **Kendra** is truthful in stating **Eloise** lies.

1. **Dylan** says the candle is lit.
2. **Corinna**, **Landry**, and **Peyton** claim that **Dylan** lies.

    - There is no testimony against **Corinna**, **Landry**, or **Peyton**. Therefore, we believe them, which means **Dylan** might be lying.

3. **Jovie** also claims that **Dylan** lies.

    - **Anwen** says that **Jovie** lies.
    - Since there's no testimony against **Anwen**, we believe **Anwen**, which means **Jovie** might be lying.
    - Therefore, we cannot trust **Jovie**’s statement about **Dylan**.

4. **Harley** claims that **Dylan** lies.

    - **Leani** says that **Harley** lies.
    - **Lyla** claims that **Leani** lies.
    - **Ivy** says that **Lyla** lies.
    - There's no testimony against **Ivy**, so we believe her.
    - This means **Lyla** might be lying, so **Leani** is telling the truth.
    - Since **Leani** says **Harley** lies, we believe **Leani** and conclude **Harley** might be lying.
    - Therefore, we cannot trust **Harley**’s statement about **Dylan**.

5. **Layne** says that **Anwen** lies.

    - **Nina** says that **Layne** lies.

1. **Calliope** says the plane is landing. We initially believe her unless credible testimony suggests she might lie.
2. **Melody** and **Janiyah** both claim that Calliope lies. No one says they might lie, so we believe them. Thus, Calliope lies about the plane landing.
3. **Sofia** also says Calliope lies, but **Leena** (a believable witness) says Sofia lies. Therefore, Sofia lies, so her claim about Calliope lying is false, suggesting Calliope tells the truth. However, we already have Melody and Janiyah's credible statements that Calliope lies.
4. **Gracie** claims Calliope lies. **Kynlee** says Gracie lies, but **Octavia** (shown to be believable through a chain of testimonies involving **Anthony**, **Jordan**, **Alistair**, and **Chloe**) says Kynlee lies. Thus, Kynlee lies, meaning Gracie tells the truth about Calliope lying.

Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. **Claire says the phone is ringing.** We initially believe Claire unless there's evidence she might lie.

2. **Roman and Zuna claim that Claire lies.** No one accuses Roman or Zuna of lying. Therefore, we believe them, which means Claire is lying about the phone ringing.

3. **Autumn claims that Claire lies,** but **Etta claims that Autumn lies.** Since no one says Etta lies, we believe Etta, which means Autumn is lying. Therefore, we cannot use Autumn's claim against Claire.

4. **Maylin claims that Claire lies,** but **Lyla claims that Maylin lies.** We believe Lyla (as no one says she lies), so Maylin is lying. Maylin's claim against Claire is invalid.

5. **Lyric claims that Claire lies,** but **Lynx claims that Lyric lies.** Believing Lynx (since no one accuses them of lying), Lyric is lying, and we dismiss their claim against Claire.

6. **Sadira claims that Claire lies.** **Mila claims that Sadira lies,** but **Quinn claims that Mila lies.** Believing Quinn, Mila is lying. Therefore, Sadira is telling the truth about Claire lying.

In summary, **Roman, Zuna, and Sadira** are credible witnesses who accuse Claire of lying, and there's no testimony against them. Therefore, Claire is lying about the phone ringing.

Question: are the lights bright?
End your answer with: ""Answer: yes or no""","To solve this reasoning puzzle, we'll carefully evaluate each witness's testimony and determine if they should be believed based on the provided guidelines.

1. **Witness Emmeline says that the lights are bright.**
   - No initial reason to doubt Emmeline unless there's testimony against her.

2. **Witness Kyson claims that Emmeline lies.**
   - No testimony against Kyson. Therefore, Kyson is telling the truth, implying Emmeline lies.

3. **Witness Dalia claims that Emmeline lies.**
   - No testimony against Dalia. Therefore, Dalia is telling the truth, reinforcing that Emmeline lies.

4. **Witness Serenity claims that Emmeline lies.**
   - **Witness Tiana claims that Serenity lies.**
     - **Witness Colton claims that Tiana lies.**
       - No testimony against Colton. Therefore, Colton tells the truth, so Tiana lies.
     - Since Tiana lies about Serenity lying, Serenity tells the truth, confirming that Emmeline lies.

5. **Witness Winslow claims that Emmeline lies.**
   - **Witness Elara claims that Winslow lies.**
     - **Witness Melody claims that Elara lies.**
       - **Witness Jada claims that Melody lies.**
         - **Witness Brielle claims that Jada lies.**
           - **Witness Jayce claims that Brielle lies.**
             - No testimony against Jayce. Therefore, Jayce tells the truth, so Brielle lies.
           - Since Brielle lies about Jada lying, Jada tells the truth.
         - Jada tells the truth that Melody lies.
       - Melody lies about Elara lying, so Elara tells the truth.
     - Elara tells the truth that Winslow lies.
   - Winslow lies about Emmeline lying, suggesting Emmeline tells the truth.

**Conflict Resolution:**

- We have two sets of reliable testimonies:
  - **Kyson, Dalia, and Serenity** (supported by Colton) all claim that Emmeline lies.
  - **Elara's chain** suggests that Emmeline tells the truth, but this chain involves more witnesses and potential for doubt.

- Given that Kyson and Dalia have no testimony against them and directly state that Emmeline lies, their testimonies are stronger and more direct.

**Conclusion:**

Emmeline lies about the lights being bright. Therefore, the lights are **not** bright.

Let's break down the testimonies:

1. **Ian** says the road is clear.
2. **Ace** claims that Ian lies.
   - No one claims that Ace lies, so we believe Ace.
3. **Leena** claims that Ian lies.
   - **Olivia** claims that Leena lies.
   - No one claims that Olivia lies, so we believe Olivia.
   - Therefore, Leena lies about Ian lying; Ian tells the truth according to this chain.
4. **Hattie** claims that Ian lies.
   - **Maverick** claims that Hattie lies.
     - **Reagan** claims that Maverick lies.
       - **Kailani** claims that Reagan lies.

               - **Soraya** claims that Felicity lies.
                 - No one claims that Soraya lies, so we believe Soraya.
               - Felicity lies about Jeremiah lying; Jeremiah tells the truth.
             - Jeremiah says Kelsey lies; Kelsey lies about Kailani lying.
           - Kailani tells the truth that Reagan lies.
         - Reagan lies about Maverick lying; Maverick tells the truth.
       - Maverick tells the truth that Hattie lies.
     - Hattie lies about Ian lying; Ian tells the truth according to this chain.
     
The chain of testimonies from Leena and Hattie ultimately supports that Ian tells the truth. However, **Ace** claims that Ian lies, and no one discredits Ace. Since Ace's testimony stands unchallenged, we have a direct claim that Ian lies.

Given that Ace's claim that Ian lies is the only unchallenged testimony against Ian, and witnesses are believed unless there's a testimony against them, we must conclude that Ian lies about the road being clear.

Let's start by identifying witnesses who are not accused of lying by anyone else:

1. **Mila**: No one says Mila lies.
2. **Stormy**: No one says Stormy lies.

**Step 1: Start with Mila**

- **Mila** says that **Brinley** lies.
  - Since no one accuses Mila of lying, we believe Mila. Therefore, **Brinley lies**.
- **Brinley** says that **Romilly** lies.
  - Since Brinley lies, her statement is false. Therefore, **Romilly tells the truth**.
- **Romilly** says that **Kaylin** lies.
  - Romilly tells the truth, so **Kaylin lies**.
- **Kaylin** says that **Nyah** lies.
  - Since Kaylin lies, her statement is false. Therefore, **Nyah tells the truth**.
- **Nyah** says that **Solara** lies.
  - Nyah tells the truth, so **Solara lies**.
- **Solara** says that **Kyson** lies.
  - Since Solara lies, her statement is false. Therefore, **Kyson tells the truth**.

**Step 2: Analyze the Chain Starting with Stormy**

- **Stormy** says that **Beckham** lies.
  - We believe Stormy (no one says Stormy lies), so **Beckham lies**.
- **Beckham** says that **Emily** lies.
  - Beckham lies, so his statement is false. Therefore, **Emily tells the truth**.
- **Emily** says that **Amity** lies.
  - Emily tells the truth, so **Amity lies**.
- **Amity** says that **Kyson** lies.
  - Since Amity lies, her statement is false. Therefore, **Kyson tells the truth**.

**Step 3: Resolving Conflicts**

- **Aubree** says that **Kyson** lies.
  - No one says Aubree lies, so we would normally believe her. However, we have contradictions because both logical chains above conclude that **Kyson tells the truth**.
  
In this situation, where the statements lead to a contradiction, and given that multiple verified witnesses support **Kyson telling the truth**, we can reasonably conclude that **Kyson tells the truth**, and **Aubree's statement is the conflicting one**.

Let's trace the statements:

1. **Zaria** says the bike is clean.
2. **Leila** claims Zaria lies.
   - **Meadow** claims Leila lies.
     - No one says Meadow lies. So, we believe Meadow, which means Leila is lying about Zaria.
       - Therefore, Zaria is telling the truth (bike is clean).

However:

3. **Hattie** claims Zaria lies.
   - **Ezra** claims Hattie lies.
     - **Jaxon** claims Ezra lies.
       - No one says Jaxon lies. So, we believe Jaxon, which means Ezra is lying about Hattie.
         - Therefore, Hattie is telling the truth (Zaria lies), contradicting our earlier conclusion.

This contradiction arises because both Meadow and Hattie are unchallenged, yet they lead to opposite conclusions about Zaria.

Given this conflicting evidence and applying the rule consistently, we find that the unchallenged testimony of **Hattie** (that Zaria lies) suggests the bike is not clean, as her claim stands despite attempts to discredit her.

- **Kieran** is not accused by anyone.
- **Ace** is not accused by anyone.
- **Claire** is not accused by anyone.

Since no one claims they lie, **we believe these witnesses.**

### Step 2: Analyze Their Statements

**Kieran** says **Aurora lies**.

- Since we believe Kieran, **Aurora lies**.

**Ace** says **Lincoln lies**.

- Since we believe Ace, **Lincoln lies**.

**Claire** says **Karina lies**.

- Since we believe Claire, **Karina lies**.

### Step 3: Use the Findings to Evaluate Other Witnesses

**Aurora** lies.

- Aurora claimed that **Remi lies**.
- Since Aurora lies, her statement is false.
- Therefore, **Remi does not lie**.
- So, **Remi tells the truth**, and the apples are ripe.

**Lincoln** lies.

- Lincoln claimed that **Lavinia lies**.
- Since Lincoln lies, his statement is false.
- Therefore, **Lavinia does not lie**.
- So, **Lavinia tells the truth**.

**Karina** lies.

- Karina claimed that **Noah lies**.
- Since Karina lies, her statement is false.
- Therefore, **Noah does not lie**.
- So, **Noah tells the truth**.

### Step 4: Continue the Chain of Testimonies

**Lavinia** tells the truth.

- Lavinia claimed that **Remi lies**.
- Since Lavinia tells the truth, **Remi lies**.

This contradicts our earlier conclusion that **Remi tells the truth**. We need to resolve this contradiction.

**Noah** tells the truth.

- Noah claimed that **Peyton lies**.
- Therefore, **Peyton lies**.

**Peyton** lies.

- Peyton claimed that **Juliet lies**.
- Since Peyton lies, her statement is false.
- Therefore, **Juliet does not lie**.
- So, **Juliet tells the truth**.

**Juliet** tells the truth.

- Juliet claimed that **Liana lies**.
- Since Juliet tells the truth, **Liana lies**.

**Liana** lies.

- Liana claimed that **Remi lies**.
- Since Liana lies, her statement is false.
- Therefore, **Remi does not lie**.
- So, **Remi tells the truth**.

### Step 5: Reconcile the Contradiction

We have two conflicting conclusions:

1. From **Aurora's chain**, we concluded **Remi tells the truth**.
2. From **Lavinia's chain**, we concluded **Remi lies**.
3. From **Liana's chain**, we again concluded **Remi tells the truth**.

Given that **witnesses are believed unless there is testimony that they might lie**, and that unchallenged witnesses (Kieran, Ace, Claire) support the conclusion that **Remi tells the truth**, we need to assess the reliability of Lavinia.

**But**:

- **Lincoln** (who accuses Lavinia of lying) is himself a liar (as per Ace).
- Therefore, Lavinia is **not** accused by a trustworthy witness.
- **No other witness claims that Lavinia lies** besides Lincoln.

Because **Lincoln** is a liar and the only one accusing Lavinia, there is **no trustworthy testimony that Lavinia lies**.

Therefore, **we must believe Lavinia**, and **she tells the truth** that **Remi lies**.

### Step 6: Final Conclusion

We have a contradiction that cannot be resolved under the given rules. However, since the unchallenged witnesses (Kieran, Ace, Claire) lead to the conclusion that **Remi tells the truth**, and there's stronger support for this conclusion, we can reasonably accept that **Remi tells the truth** and the apples are ripe.

End your answer with: ""Answer: yes or no""","To determine whether the computer is on, we need to evaluate the credibility of the witnesses based on the given statements and the rule that ""Witnesses should be believed unless there is testimony that they might lie.""

1. **Joseph** says the computer is on.

2. **Tilly** claims **Joseph** lies.
   - There's no credible testimony that **Tilly** lies (since **Skylar's** accusation is undermined by **Jada**).

3. **Skylar** claims **Tilly** lies.
   - **Jada** claims **Skylar** lies.
   - No one claims **Jada** lies, so **Jada** is credible.
   - Therefore, **Skylar** might be lying.

Since **Tilly** is credible and says **Joseph** lies, **Joseph** is untrustworthy. Therefore, his statement that the computer is on cannot be trusted.

Similarly, **Ethan** claims **Joseph** lies, and through a chain of credible witnesses (**Camryn** is credible as accusations against her are undermined), **Ethan** also becomes untrustworthy.

Thus, both **Tilly** and **Camryn** (credible witnesses) indicate that **Joseph** is lying. Therefore, we conclude that the computer is not on.

Let's analyze the testimonies in order:

1. **Skya** says, ""The coffee is cold.""
2. **Penelope** claims that **Skya** lies.
   - **Kamryn** claims that **Penelope** lies.
     - **Octavia** claims that **Kamryn** lies.
       - No one claims **Octavia** lies, so we believe **Octavia**.

           - Therefore, **Kaylani** lies about **Lizbeth** lying.
           - This means **Lizbeth** is telling the truth when she says **Skya** lies.

Question: is the teacher speaking?
End your answer with: ""Answer: yes or no""","To solve this puzzle, let’s analyze the statements step by step, keeping in mind the rule: **Witnesses should be believed unless there is testimony that they might lie**.

**First Chain:**

1. **Hudson** says the teacher is speaking.
2. **Jaylani** claims that Hudson lies.
3. **Amira** claims that Jaylani lies.
4. **Azaria** claims that Amira lies.

- Since no one says that **Azaria** lies, we believe **Azaria**.
- **Azaria** says **Amira** lies; thus, **Amira** is lying.
- **Amira** (who is lying) said that **Jaylani** lies, so **Jaylani** is telling the truth.
- **Jaylani** (truthful) says that **Hudson** lies; therefore, **Hudson** is lying about the teacher speaking.

**Second Chain:**

5. **Angela** claims that Hudson lies.
6. **Emma** claims that Angela lies.
7. **Emersyn** claims that Emma lies.
8. **Noah** claims that Emersyn lies.

- Since no one says that **Noah** lies, we believe **Noah**.
- **Noah** says **Emersyn** lies; thus, **Emersyn** is lying.
- **Emersyn** (lying) said that **Emma** lies; so **Emma** is telling the truth.
- **Emma** (truthful) says that **Angela** lies; thus, **Angela** is lying.
- **Angela** (lying) claimed that **Hudson** lies; therefore, **Hudson** is telling the truth about the teacher speaking.

**Third Chain:**

9. **Meadow** claims that Hudson lies.
10. **Faye** claims that Meadow lies.
11. **Madelyn** claims that Faye lies.
12. **Summer** claims that Madelyn lies.

- Since no one says that **Summer** lies, we believe **Summer**.
- **Summer** says **Madelyn** lies; thus, **Madelyn** is lying.
- **Madelyn** (lying) said that **Faye** lies; so **Faye** is telling the truth.
- **Faye** (truthful) says **Meadow** lies; thus, **Meadow** is lying.
- **Meadow** (lying) claimed that **Hudson** lies; therefore, **Hudson** is telling the truth about the teacher speaking.

**Conclusion:**

There is a contradiction in the first chain (where Hudson is lying) and the other two chains (where Hudson is telling the truth). However, the rule states that witnesses are to be believed unless there's testimony that they might lie. Since **Azaria** is the only one who hasn't been accused of lying in the first chain, and her testimony leads to Hudson lying, but this conflicts with the other chains where witnesses not accused of lying support Hudson telling the truth.

Given that the majority of unchallenged witnesses support **Hudson** telling the truth, and to resolve the contradiction in favor of the rule, we conclude that **Hudson is telling the truth**.

Witness Christian claims that witness Romilly lies.
Witness Nova claims that witness Christian lies.
Witness Matthew claims that witness Nova lies.

Witness Sophia claims that witness Devyn lies.
Witness Leani claims that witness Sophia lies.
Witness Orion claims that witness Leani lies.
Question: is the fridge empty?
End your answer with: ""Answer: yes or no""","To solve this puzzle, we need to determine whether the fridge is empty by analyzing the witnesses' statements, following the rule that witnesses are believed unless there's testimony that they might lie.

Let's identify the unopposed witnesses—those whom no one accuses of lying:

1. **Matthew**: Says that **Nova** lies.
2. **Orion**: Says that **Leani** lies.

Following the chain from **Matthew**:

- Since **Matthew** is unopposed, we trust him and conclude **Nova** lies.
- **Nova** (who lies) says **Christian** lies, but since she lies, **Christian** does **not** lie.
- **Christian** (now trusted) says **Romilly** lies.
- **Romilly** (who lies) says **Nyah** lies, but since **Romilly** lies, **Nyah** does **not** lie.
- **Nyah** (trusted) says **Marigold** lies.

Following the chain from **Orion**:

- **Orion** is unopposed, so **Leani** lies.
- **Leani** (who lies) says **Sophia** lies, but **Sophia** does **not** lie.
- **Sophia** (trusted) says **Devyn** lies.
- **Devyn** (who lies) says **Janiyah** lies, but **Janiyah** does **not** lie.
- **Janiyah** (trusted) says **Maxine** lies.
- **Maxine** (who lies) says **Marigold** lies, but since **Maxine** lies, this suggests **Marigold** tells the truth.

Now, we have conflicting conclusions about **Marigold**:

- From **Nyah** (trusted), **Marigold** lies.
- From the chain involving **Maxine** (who lies about **Marigold** lying), it suggests **Marigold** tells the truth.

However, since **Nyah** is trusted and directly claims **Marigold** lies, and **Maxine** (though she lies) does not negate **Nyah**'s claim, we accept that **Marigold** lies.

Therefore, **Marigold's** statement that the fridge is empty is a lie, so the fridge is **not** empty.

Question: is the blanket soft?
End your answer with: ""Answer: yes or no""","To solve this puzzle, we need to determine whether the blanket is soft based on the witnesses' statements, following the rule that witnesses should be believed unless there is testimony that they might lie.

Let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Noah** says the blanket is soft.
2. **Sariyah** says that Noah lies.
   - No one says that Sariyah lies, so we believe her. Therefore, Noah is lying, so the blanket is not soft.
3. **Zaiden** also says that Noah lies.
   - Again, no one says that Zaiden lies, so we believe him, reinforcing that Noah lies.
4. **Soraya** says that Noah lies.
5. **Livia** says that Soraya lies.
   - Since no one says Livia lies (yet), we believe her. Therefore, Soraya is lying, which would mean Noah tells the truth, contradicting Sariyah and Zaiden.
6. **Rina** says that Livia lies.
   - No one says Rina lies, so we believe her. This means Livia is lying, so Soraya tells the truth, which aligns with Sariyah and Zaiden.
7. **Renata** says that Rina lies.
   - We believe Renata, so Rina is lying, meaning Livia tells the truth, and Soraya is lying, conflicting again.
8. **Charles** says that Renata lies.
   - Believing Charles means Renata lies, so Rina tells the truth, and so on.

This pattern continues with each witness contradicting the previous one. The chain of accusations leads to a logical inconsistency if we try to assign absolute truth or falsehood based on each statement individually.

However, considering the parity of the chain (the number of witnesses stating that the previous witness lies), we find that the total number of witnesses making these accusations is **odd**. An odd number of negations leads back to the original assertion being negated. Therefore, the initial claim that Noah lies (from Sariyah and Zaiden) is ultimately negated by the chain of contradictions.

Thus, despite the initial statements against Noah, the chain of contradicting testimonies leads us to conclude that Noah is telling the truth.

**Witnesses should be believed unless there is testimony that they might lie.**

Here's a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Hazel says the soup is salty.**

2. **Witnesses Claiming Hazel Lies:**
   - **Roslyn** says Hazel lies.
   - **Kiera** says Hazel lies.
   - **Sienna** says Hazel lies.
   - **Christopher** says Hazel lies.

3. **Evaluating the Credibility of Witnesses Accusing Hazel:**
   - **Roslyn**, **Kiera**, and **Sienna** are not accused of lying by anyone. Therefore, we believe them when they say Hazel lies.
   - **Christopher** is accused of lying by **Hudson**, but we need to evaluate Hudson's credibility.

4. **Chain of Accusations:**

   - **Hudson** says **Christopher** lies.
   - **Alistair** says **Hudson** lies.
   - **Taylor** says **Alistair** lies.
   - **Raegan** says **Taylor** lies.
   - **Octavia** says **Raegan** lies.
   - **Amayah** says **Octavia** lies.
   - **Salvador** says **Amayah** lies.
   - **Cassius** says **Salvador** lies.

5. **Evaluating the Credibility of Witnesses in the Chain:**

   - **Cassius** is not accused by anyone, so we believe him when he says **Salvador** lies.
   - Since **Salvador** is accused by **Cassius**, we cannot trust **Salvador**'s accusation of **Amayah**.
   - **Amayah** is only accused by **Salvador** (whom we don't trust), so we believe **Amayah** when she says **Octavia** lies.
   - We cannot trust **Octavia**'s accusation of **Raegan**.
   - **Raegan** is unchallenged, so we believe her when she says **Taylor** lies.
   - We cannot trust **Taylor**'s accusation of **Alistair**.
   - **Alistair** is unchallenged, so we believe him when he says **Hudson** lies.
   - We cannot trust **Hudson**'s accusation of **Christopher**.
   - Therefore, **Christopher** is only accused by **Hudson** (whom we don't trust), so we believe **Christopher** when he says **Hazel** lies.

6. **Conclusion:**

   - **Hazel** is credibly accused of lying by **Roslyn**, **Kiera**, **Sienna**, and **Christopher** (all unchallenged).
   - Since **Hazel** lies about the soup being salty, we conclude the soup is **not** salty.

1. **Leoni says the sun is shining.**
2. **Zane, Tori, Olwen, and John** each claim that **Leoni lies**.

We have **four witnesses (Zane, Tori, Olwen, John)** who assert that Leoni lies. There is no testimony suggesting that any of these four witnesses might lie. According to the rule, we must believe them unless there is evidence to the contrary.

Although Briella also claims that Leoni lies, Kennedy claims that Briella lies. This introduces doubt about Briella's reliability. Further testimonies create a chain that questions the honesty of subsequent witnesses (Kennedy, Hudson, Stormy, Tessa, Ezra, Micah, and Ashby). However, this chain does not affect the credibility of Zane, Tori, Olwen, and John, as no one has testified that they might lie.

Now, let's analyze:

- **Kennedy** says **Ivan lies**. Since there's no testimony against **Kennedy**, we believe **Kennedy**, so **Ivan** lies.

- Since **Kynlee** lies about **Shiloh** lying, **Shiloh** is telling the truth. Therefore, **Grace** lies (because **Shiloh** says **Grace** lies).
- Since **Grace** lies about **Alani** lying, we discard **Grace**'s testimony.

However, we still have **Arden**, **Nyah**, **Emma**, **Lennox**, **Robert**, and **Isaac** stating that **Alani lies**, with no testimony against them. Therefore, we conclude that **Alani** is lying.

   - **Initial Trust:** We should believe Raelynn unless there's testimony suggesting she lies.

2. **Witnesses Kyrah, Ethan, Emma, Wyatt, Ramiro, Delilah, Nia, and Sariah claim that Raelynn lies.**
   - **Assessment:** Since none of these eight witnesses are accused of lying by anyone else, we have no reason to doubt their honesty. Therefore, their collective testimony suggests that Raelynn is lying.

3. **Witness Kieran claims that Raelynn lies.**
   - **Complication:** Witness Inez claims that Kieran lies.
     - Since no one accuses Inez of lying (Marigold's accusation is invalid as explained below), we trust Inez, concluding that Kieran is lying.
     - **Conclusion:** Kieran's claim that Raelynn lies is false, reinforcing the possibility that Raelynn might be telling the truth. However, with eight other witnesses accusing Raelynn of lying, Kieran's contradiction doesn't outweigh the majority.

4. **Witness Inez claims that Kieran lies.**
   - As established, we trust Inez because there's no credible testimony against her.

5. **Witness Marigold claims that Inez lies.**
   - **Issue:** Witness Greyson claims that Marigold lies.
     - Since no one accuses Greyson of lying, we trust Greyson, concluding that Marigold is lying.

   - **We trust Hannah**, reinforcing that **Carson lies**.

6. **Quinn** claims that **Carson lies**.
   - **Andrew** claims that **Quinn lies**.
   - No one says Andrew lies.
   - **We trust Andrew**, so **Quinn lies**.
   - Since Quinn lies, we cannot trust Quinn's claim about Carson.

7. **Mila** claims that **Carson lies**.
   - **Imani** claims that **Mila lies**.
   - **Charlotte** claims that **Imani lies**.
   - No one says Charlotte lies.
   - **We trust Charlotte**, so **Imani lies**.
   - Since Imani lies, her claim about Mila is false.
   - Therefore, **Mila tells the truth**, reinforcing that **Carson lies**.

8. **Alivia** claims that **Carson lies**.
   - **Mallory** claims that **Alivia lies**.
   - **Phoenix** claims that **Mallory lies**.
   - No one says Phoenix lies.
   - **We trust Phoenix**, so **Mallory lies**.
   - Since Mallory lies, her claim about Alivia is false.
   - Therefore, **Alivia tells the truth**, reinforcing that **Carson lies**.

---

**Summary**:

- **Carson** is claimed to be lying by **Gianna**, **Kennedy**, **Austin**, **Hannah**, **Mila**, and **Alivia**.
- All these witnesses are **trusted**, as there is no valid testimony against them.
- Therefore, **Carson lies**.

**Conclusion**:

Since Carson lies about the ocean being deep, the statement ""**the ocean is deep**"" is **false**.

**Witness Statements:**

1. **Elysia** says that **the clock is ticking**.
2. **Freya** claims that **Elysia lies**.
3. **Tilly** claims that **Elysia lies**.

12. **Ramiro** claims that **Skye lies**.
13. **Carson** claims that **Ramiro lies**.

**Analysis:**

Let's evaluate each witness based on the testimonies about them:

- **Elysia**: Claims the clock is ticking. Multiple witnesses accuse her of lying.

- **Freya**, **Tilly**, **Mariah**, and **Skye**: Each says that **Elysia lies**. No one accuses them of lying, so we accept their statements as truth.

- **Rhiannon**: Says that **Elysia lies**. However, **Peyton** claims that **Rhiannon lies**. Since no one accuses **Peyton** of lying, we believe **Peyton**, which means **Rhiannon** is lying. Therefore, **Rhiannon**'s statement that **Elysia lies** is false, suggesting that **Elysia tells the truth**.

- **Kynlee**: Says that **Elysia lies**. **Liora** claims that **Kynlee lies**. No one accuses **Liora** of lying, so we believe **Liora**, which means **Kynlee** is lying. Therefore, **Kynlee**'s statement that **Elysia lies** is false, suggesting that **Elysia tells the truth**.

- **Angela**: Says that **Elysia lies**. **Quinn** claims that **Angela lies**. No one accuses **Quinn** of lying, so we believe **Quinn**, which means **Angela** is lying. Therefore, **Angela**'s statement that **Elysia lies** is false, suggesting that **Elysia tells the truth**.

- **Ramiro**: Says that **Skye lies**. **Carson** claims that **Ramiro lies**. No one accuses **Carson** of lying, so we believe **Carson**, which means **Ramiro** is lying. Therefore, **Ramiro**'s statement that **Skye lies** is false, so **Skye tells the truth**.

**Conclusions:**

- **Freya**, **Tilly**, **Mariah**, and **Skye** are truthful when they say **Elysia lies**.
- **Rhiannon**, **Kynlee**, and **Angela** are lying when they say **Elysia lies**.
- **Elysia** is accused of lying by four trustworthy witnesses.
- **Elysia** is defended by the fact that some accusers are lying, but there are still four unchallenged accusers.
  
Since multiple trustworthy witnesses (**Freya**, **Tilly**, **Mariah**, **Skye**) assert that **Elysia lies**, and there is no testimony against them, we conclude that **Elysia is lying**. Therefore, her claim that the clock is ticking is false.

Question: are the shoes dirty?
End your answer with: ""Answer: yes or no""","To solve this reasoning puzzle, we need to determine whether the shoes are dirty based on the witness statements provided. According to the rules, we believe a witness unless there is testimony that they might lie.

Here's a breakdown of the witness statements:

1. **Juliet** says the shoes are dirty.
2. **Asher**, **Leah**, **Bruno**, **Kendra**, and **Gianna** each claim that **Juliet** lies.
3. **Jorja** claims that **Kendra** lies.
4. **Evan** claims that **Jorja** lies.
5. **Sabel** claims that **Evan** lies.
6. **Kenna** claims that **Gianna** lies.
7. **Ember** claims that **Kenna** lies.
8. **Lydia** claims that **Ember** lies.
9. **Elara** claims that **Lydia** lies.

Now, let's analyze:

- **Asher**, **Leah**, and **Bruno** accuse **Juliet** of lying. No one accuses these three of lying, so we believe them. Therefore, **Juliet** lies, and the shoes are not dirty.
  
- **Gianna** also accuses **Juliet** of lying. While **Kenna** accuses **Gianna** of lying, there is a chain of accusations leading back to **Elara**:
  - **Kenna** is accused of lying by **Ember**.
  - **Ember** is accused of lying by **Lydia**.
  - **Lydia** is accused of lying by **Elara**.
  - **Elara** has no accusations against her, so we believe her.
  - Therefore, **Lydia** lies, so **Ember** tells the truth, meaning **Kenna** lies, and thus **Gianna** tells the truth. This supports that **Juliet** lies.

- **Kendra** accuses **Juliet** of lying but is accused by **Jorja** of lying. There's a chain:
  - **Jorja** is accused by **Evan**.
  - **Evan** is accused by **Sabel**.
  - **Sabel** has no accusations against her, so we believe her.
  - Therefore, **Evan** lies, so **Jorja** tells the truth, meaning **Kendra** lies.
  - **Kendra** lying would suggest that **Juliet** tells the truth, but this conflicts with the unchallenged testimonies of **Asher**, **Leah**, **Bruno**, and **Gianna**.

Since multiple unchallenged witnesses (**Asher**, **Leah**, **Bruno**, **Gianna**) say **Juliet** lies, and only one chain leads to the opposite conclusion (through **Kendra**), we accept the majority of unchallenged testimonies.

Question: is the soup salty?
End your answer with: ""Answer: yes or no""","To solve this puzzle, let's analyze the testimonies carefully, keeping in mind the rule: witnesses are to be believed unless there is testimony that they might lie.

1. **Teagan** says the soup is **salty**.
2. **Anabella** says that **Teagan lies**. No one says Anabella lies, so we believe her. Therefore, Teagan lies about the soup being salty.
3. **Journey** also says that **Teagan lies**. Again, no one says Journey lies, so we believe her too, reinforcing that Teagan lies.
4. **Isla** says that **Teagan lies**, but **Zaniyah** says **Isla lies**. No one says Zaniyah lies, so we believe Zaniyah. Therefore, Isla lies about Teagan, which implies Teagan tells the truth. However, since we have already established from Anabella and Journey (who are both unchallenged) that Teagan lies, the testimony from Isla (through Zaniyah) doesn't overturn that conclusion.
5. Similar patterns occur with **Angela** (challenged by **Kamara**), **Maren** (challenged by **Josephine**), and **Cora** (challenged by **Phoenix**, with additional layers of testimonies supporting Phoenix's truthfulness). In all these cases, the chain of testimonies leads us to believe that Teagan tells the truth. However, these are outweighed by the unchallenged testimonies of Anabella and Journey.
6. Since the only unchallenged testimonies about Teagan come from Anabella and Journey, both stating that Teagan lies, we conclude that Teagan is lying about the soup being salty.

Let's analyze each witness:

1. **Avani** says the bus is full.

    - However, **Henry** and **Faye** claim that Avani lies.
    - Since no one says that Henry or Faye might lie, their testimonies are trustworthy.
    - Therefore, Avani might be lying, and we cannot rely on her statement.

2. **Henry** claims that Avani lies.

    - No testimony against Henry; he is trustworthy.

3. **Faye** claims that Avani lies.

    - No testimony against Faye; she is trustworthy.

4. **Lincoln** claims that Avani lies.

    - **Lucas** says Lincoln lies.
    - Lucas is trustworthy (no testimony against him), so Lincoln might be lying.

5. **Lucas** claims that Lincoln lies.

    - Trustworthy.

6. **Scarlett** claims that Avani lies.

    - **Jorja** says Scarlett lies.
    - Jorja is trustworthy, so Scarlett might be lying.

7. **Jorja** claims that Scarlett lies.

    - Trustworthy.

8. **Leah** claims that Avani lies.

    - **Owen** says Leah lies.

9. **Owen** claims that Leah lies.

    - Trustworthy.

10. **Holly** claims that Avani lies.

     - Nova is trustworthy, so Holly might be lying.

11. **Nova** claims that Holly lies.

     - Trustworthy.

12. **Jovan** claims that Avani lies.

     - **Zoe** says Jovan lies.
     - Zoe is trustworthy, so Jovan might be lying.

13. **Zoe** claims that Jovan lies.

     - Trustworthy.

Summarizing:

- **Henry** and **Faye** are trustworthy witnesses who say that Avani lies.
- Avani's statement about the bus being full is unreliable.
- No other trustworthy witness provides information about the bus being full.

**Conclusion:** Since Avani's testimony is unreliable and no trustworthy witness confirms that the bus is full, we cannot conclude that the bus is full.

End your answer with: ""Answer: yes or no""","To solve this reasoning puzzle, let's start by identifying and analyzing the statements made by the witnesses, considering the instruction that ""witnesses should be believed unless there is testimony that they might lie."" We'll assume that witnesses are truthful unless someone alleges that they are lying.

**Witness Statements:**
1. **Shiloh** says the **pizza is cold**.
2. **Elina** says that **Shiloh lies**.
3. **Ella** says that **Shiloh lies**.
4. **Zaila** says that **Shiloh lies**.

11. **Lorelei** says that **Emma lies**.
12. **Laila** says that **Lorelei lies**.
13. **Reyna** says that **Laila lies**.

**Analysis:**

- **Witnesses with No Accusations Against Them:**
  - **Elina**
  - **Ella**
  - **Kyra**
  - **Keira**
  - **Reyna**

These witnesses are to be believed because no one accuses them of lying.

1. **Elina** and **Ella** both state that **Shiloh lies**. Since no one accuses them of lying, we accept their testimony. Therefore, **Shiloh is lying**.

2. **Kyra** says that **Zaila lies**. Since we believe Kyra, **Zaila is lying**.

3. **Zaila** claimed that **Shiloh lies**. Since Zaila is lying (as per Kyra's testimony), her statement that Shiloh is lying is false, meaning **Shiloh is actually telling the truth**.

Now we have a contradiction:
- **Elina** and **Ella** (trusted witnesses) say **Shiloh is lying**.
- **Zaila** (a lying witness) indirectly suggests **Shiloh is telling the truth** (since her statement that Shiloh lies is a lie).

This contradiction indicates that there's inconsistency in our assumptions. However, the initial instruction tells us to believe witnesses unless there's testimony that they might lie.

4. **Keira** says that **Aris lies**. Since we believe Keira, **Aris is lying**.

5. **Aris** claimed that **Elira lies**. Since Aris is lying, **Elira is telling the truth**.

6. **Elira** says that **Colette lies**. Thus, **Colette is lying**.

7. **Colette** said that **Shiloh lies**. Since Colette is lying, her claim is false, and **Shiloh is telling the truth**.

Again, we have conflicting conclusions regarding **Shiloh's honesty**.

8. **Reyna** says that **Laila lies**. Since we believe Reyna, **Laila is lying**.

9. **Laila** claimed that **Lorelei lies**. Since Laila is lying, **Lorelei is telling the truth**.

10. **Lorelei** says that **Emma lies**. Therefore, **Emma is lying**.

11. **Emma** said that **Shiloh lies**. Since Emma is lying, her claim is false, and **Shiloh is telling the truth**.

This supports the conclusion that **Shiloh is telling the truth**, meaning the **pizza is cold**.

However, this contradicts the earlier conclusion from **Elina** and **Ella** (trusted witnesses) that **Shiloh lies**.

**Final Determination:**
Given that **Elina** and **Ella** are unaccused and directly state that **Shiloh lies**, we must accept that **Shiloh is lying**, according to the initial instruction. The conflicting testimonies arise from witnesses who are either accused of lying or whose credibility is dependent on others who are accused.

Therefore, since **Shiloh is lying** about the pizza being cold, the **pizza is not cold**.

         - Therefore, Kyra might lie, so Brooklyn may be truthful, meaning Hazel might lie, Zalia may be truthful, and Daxton might lie.

After considering testimonies and who might be lying, we conclude:

- **Lyla** and **Bella** are trustworthy witnesses who say that **Mariah** lies.
- Therefore, **Mariah** likely lies about the shoes being dirty.

Question: is the house big?
End your answer with: ""Answer: yes or no""","To solve this puzzle, we'll analyze the chain of witness statements and apply the rule: ""Witnesses should be believed unless there is testimony that they might lie.""

1. **Calliope** says, ""The house is big.""
2. **Sarah** says, ""Calliope lies."" No one accuses Sarah of lying, so we believe her. Therefore, Calliope lies.
3. **Madison** says, ""Calliope lies."" No one accuses Madison of lying, so we believe her. This corroborates that Calliope lies.
4. **Octavia** says, ""Calliope lies.""
   - **Eithne** says, ""Octavia lies.""
     - **Christian** says, ""Eithne lies.""
       - **Braelyn** says, ""Christian lies.""
         - **Freya** says, ""Braelyn lies."" No one accuses Freya of lying, so we believe her.
         - Since Freya says Braelyn lies, Braelyn is lying about Christian.
       - Since Braelyn lies, Christian tells the truth about Eithne.
     - Since Christian tells the truth that Eithne lies, Eithne is lying about Octavia.
   - Since Eithne lies about Octavia, Octavia tells the truth that Calliope lies.
5. **Daisy** says, ""Calliope lies.""
   - **Ian** says, ""Daisy lies.""
     - **Collins** says, ""Ian lies.""
       - **Keira** says, ""Collins lies.""
         - **Daniel** says, ""Keira lies."" No one accuses Daniel of lying, so we believe him.
         - Since Daniel says Keira lies, Keira is lying about Collins.
       - Since Keira lies, Collins tells the truth about Ian.
     - Since Collins tells the truth that Ian lies, Ian is lying about Daisy.
   - Since Ian lies about Daisy, Daisy tells the truth that Calliope lies.

All witnesses who accuse Calliope of lying are either unchallenged or, through the chain of statements, proven to be telling the truth. Therefore, Calliope is lying when she says the house is big.

**Witness Statements:**

1. **Greer** says that **the dog is happy**.
2. **Cassius** claims that **Greer lies**.
3. **Zuna** claims that **Greer lies**.

11. **Aracely** claims that **Sariah lies**.
12. **Kamryn** claims that **Aracely lies**.
13. **Melanie** claims that **Kamryn lies**.

**Analysis:**

Let's assess the credibility of each witness, starting from the witnesses whose credibility is unquestioned.

1. **Melanie**: No one claims that Melanie lies. Therefore, we believe Melanie.
   - Melanie says that **Kamryn lies**.
   - **Conclusion**: Kamryn is lying.

2. **Kamryn** (found to be lying):
   - Kamryn says that **Aracely lies**.
   - Since Kamryn is lying, **Aracely is telling the truth**.

3. **Aracely** (trusted):
   - Aracely says that **Sariah lies**.
   - **Conclusion**: Sariah is lying.

4. **Sariah** (found to be lying):
   - Sariah says that **Jada lies**.
   - Since Sariah is lying, **Jada is telling the truth**.

5. **Jada** (trusted):
   - Jada says that **Greer lies**.
   - **Conclusion**: Greer is lying.

6. **Cassius**: No one claims that Cassius lies. Therefore, we believe Cassius.
   - Cassius says that **Greer lies**.
   - **Conclusion**: Greer is lying.

7. **Maverick**: No one claims that Maverick lies. Therefore, we believe Maverick.
   - Maverick says that **Zuna lies**.
   - **Conclusion**: Zuna is lying.

8. **Zuna** (found to be lying):
   - Zuna says that **Greer lies**.
   - Since Zuna is lying, **Greer is telling the truth**.
   - However, this contradicts the earlier conclusion that Greer is lying based on Cassius and Jada's testimonies.

9. **Talia**: No one claims that Talia lies. Therefore, we believe Talia.
   - Talia says that **Tori lies**.
   - **Conclusion**: Tori is lying.

10. **Tori** (found to be lying):
    - Tori says that **Greer lies**.
    - Since Tori is lying, **Greer is telling the truth**.
    - Again, this contradicts the earlier conclusion.

11. **Skya**: No one claims that Skya lies. Therefore, we believe Skya.
    - Skya says that **Josie lies**.
    - **Conclusion**: Josie is lying.

12. **Josie** (found to be lying):
    - Josie says that **Greer lies**.
    - Since Josie is lying, **Greer is telling the truth**.

**Reconciling the Contradictions:**

- **Trusted witnesses saying Greer lies**: Cassius and Jada.
- **Trusted witnesses saying Greer tells the truth**: Indirectly, through the discrediting of those who accused Greer of lying (Zuna, Tori, Josie).

Since Cassius and Jada directly and credibly claim that Greer lies, and there are more credible witnesses confirming that Greer is lying than there are confirming he is telling the truth, we conclude that **Greer is lying** about the dog being happy.

Let's analyze the witnesses:

1. **Fiera** says the bus is full.
2. **Zinnia** says Fiera lies.
   - No one accuses Zinnia of lying, so she is truthful.
   - Therefore, Fiera is lying.
3. **Anwen** says Fiera lies.
   - **Parker** (truthful, as no one accuses him) says Anwen lies.
   - So, Anwen is lying.
4. **Elara** says Fiera lies.
   - **Taliah** (truthful) says Elara lies.
   - So, Elara is lying.
5. **Aidan** says Fiera lies.
   - **Mateo** (truthful) says Aidan lies.
   - So, Aidan is lying.
6. **Dylan** says Fiera lies.

   - So, Dylan is lying.
7. **Nora** says Fiera lies.
   - **Greer** says Nora lies.

**Witness Testimonies:**
1. **Isaac**: *The train is late.*
2. **Scarlett**: *Isaac lies.*
3. **Monroe**: *Isaac lies.*
4. **Teagan**: *Monroe lies.*
5. **Max**: *Isaac lies.*

13. **Tenley**: *Adrian lies.*

**Analysis:**

1. **Scarlett says Isaac lies.** No one says Scarlett might lie, so we believe Scarlett. Therefore, **Isaac lies** about the train being late, so the train is **not late**.

2. **Monroe says Isaac lies.** However, **Teagan says Monroe lies**. No one says Teagan might lie, so we believe Teagan. Thus, **Monroe lies**, meaning Isaac tells the truth, indicating the train **is late**.

3. **Max says Isaac lies.** **Kynlee says Max lies**. **Xavier says Kynlee lies**. **Tinsley says Xavier lies**. No one says Tinsley might lie, so we believe Tinsley. Therefore, **Xavier lies**, so **Kynlee tells the truth** that **Max lies**, meaning Isaac tells the truth, suggesting the train **is late**.

4. **Kaiya says Isaac lies.** **Maylin says Kaiya lies**. **Devyn says Maylin lies**. **Adrian says Devyn lies**. **Tenley says Adrian lies**. No one says Tenley might lie, so we believe Tenley. Therefore, **Adrian lies**, so **Devyn tells the truth** that **Maylin lies**, meaning **Kaiya tells the truth** that **Isaac lies**, indicating the train is **not late**.

**Conclusion:**
- There is conflicting testimony about whether Isaac lies.
- However, both **Scarlett** and **Kaiya** independently and credibly state that Isaac lies.
- The testimonies indicating Isaac tells the truth rely on longer chains with more opportunities for contradictions.

1. **Jaxson says that the car is new.**
2. **James claims that Jaxson lies.** No one says that James lies, so we have to consider James truthful. Therefore, there is testimony that Jaxson might lie.
3. **Ezra claims that Jaxson lies.** Aris claims that Ezra lies, but Kinley claims that Aris lies. Since Kinley is truthful (no testimony against Kinley), Aris might be lying about Ezra. Therefore, Ezra is truthful, providing more testimony that Jaxson might lie.
4. **Amelia claims that Jaxson lies.** Anwen claims that Amelia lies, but Kyla claims that Anwen lies. Imani claims that Kyla lies, Elsie claims that Imani lies, Ashby claims that Elsie lies, Philomena claims that Ashby lies, and Hudson claims that Philomena lies. No one says that Hudson lies, so Hudson is truthful. Therefore, Philomena might be lying about Ashby, making Ashby truthful, and so on back up the chain. This ultimately leads to Amelia being a liar or truthful depending on the chain, but given the complexity, we can focus on the clear testimonies.

Since both James and Ezra, whom we consider truthful, claim that Jaxson lies, we have sufficient testimony that Jaxson might lie. Therefore, we should not believe Jaxson's statement that the car is new.

**Witnesses and their statements:**

1. **Ivan** says, ""The door is locked.""

2. **James** says, ""Ivan lies.""
   - No one says James lies, so **James is telling the truth**.
   - Therefore, **Ivan lies**, meaning the door is *not* locked.

3. **Emersyn** says, ""Ivan lies.""
   - **Maxine** says, ""Emersyn lies.""

               - No one says Jorja lies, so **Jorja is telling the truth**.
               - Therefore, **Saige lies**, so **Briar tells the truth**.
           - Since Briar tells the truth, **Romilly lies**, so **Janiyah tells the truth**.
       - Janiyah tells the truth, so **Maxine lies**, meaning **Emersyn tells the truth**.
   - Emersyn tells the truth, so **Ivan lies**, which aligns with James's statement.

4. **Brielle** says, ""Ivan lies.""

     - **Tessa** says, ""Marlee lies.""
       - **Lizbeth** says, ""Tessa lies.""
         - No one says Lizbeth lies, so **Lizbeth is telling the truth**.
       - Lizbeth tells the truth, so **Tessa lies**, meaning **Marlee tells the truth**.
   - Marlee tells the truth, so **Brielle lies**, but since Brielle lies about Ivan lying, it suggests Ivan tells the truth, conflicting with the earlier conclusion.

**Conclusion:**

- We have conflicting evidence: James and Emersyn (supported by the chain of witnesses) indicate that Ivan lies (the door is not locked).
- The contradiction arises due to the conflicting statements about whether Ivan lies or tells the truth.
- Given that witnesses are believed unless testified against and considering the consistent testimony from James and Emersyn that Ivan lies (with no one saying they lie), the stronger conclusion is that **Ivan lies**, and thus the door is **not** locked.

   - **Accusations against Liza**:
     - **Ayla** says Liza lies.
     - **Leena** says Liza lies.

   - **Christopher** says Leena lies.
   - **Madelyn** says Christopher lies.
   - **Inez** says Madelyn lies.
     - No one accuses Inez of lying.

**Determining the Truth:**
- Since **Ayla** is a liar, her statement *""Callen lies""* is false, which would suggest **Callen tells the truth**. However, this conflicts with the multiple unchallenged witnesses who say **Callen lies**.
- Similarly, **Charlie** is a liar, and his statement *""Callen lies""* is false, again suggesting **Callen tells the truth**, which again conflicts with the unchallenged witnesses.
- The unchallenged witnesses predominantly say **Callen lies**, and since their credibility is unchallenged, we accept their testimony.

**Conclusion:**
- **Callen lies** about the milk being spoiled.
- Therefore, **the milk is not spoiled**.

Witness Anabella claims that witness Isla lies.
Witness Tiana claims that witness Anabella lies.
Question: is the sun shining?
End your answer with: ""Answer: yes or no""","To solve this puzzle, we need to determine whether Isla is telling the truth when she says that the sun is shining. According to the guidelines, witnesses should be believed unless there's testimony that they might lie.

Here are the key points:

1. **Isla says the sun is shining.** 

2. **Ten witnesses claim that Isla lies:**
   - Elina
   - Ryan
   - Freya
   - Kailani
   - Samuel
   - Skya
   - Keira
   - Tatum
   - Jonathan
   - Anabella

3. **Three witnesses claim that some of these accusers lie:**
   - Aracely says Tatum lies.
   - Monroe says Jonathan lies.
   - Tiana says Anabella lies.

Now, let's assess the reliability of each witness:

- **Elina, Ryan, Freya, Kailani, Samuel, Skya, and Keira** accuse Isla of lying, and there is no testimony against them. Therefore, they are considered truthful.
  
- **Tatum, Jonathan, and Anabella** also accuse Isla of lying, but there is testimony against them:
   - Tatum is accused of lying by Aracely.
   - Jonathan is accused of lying by Monroe.
   - Anabella is accused of lying by Tiana.

According to the guidelines, since there's testimony that Tatum, Jonathan, and Anabella might lie, we cannot fully trust their statements.

However, we still have **seven unchallenged witnesses** (Elina, Ryan, Freya, Kailani, Samuel, Skya, and Keira) who assert that Isla is lying. Since these witnesses are deemed truthful and there's no testimony against them, we have strong reason to believe that Isla is indeed lying.

Therefore, if Isla is lying when she says the sun is shining, the sun is **not** shining.

Question: is the wind strong?
End your answer with: ""Answer: yes or no""","To determine whether the wind is strong, let's analyze the statements and apply the rule: witnesses should be believed unless there is testimony that they might lie.

1. **Witness Zaylee says that the wind is strong.**

2. **Witnesses who claim that Zaylee lies:**
   - **Tilly**
   - **Lucas**
   - **Xanthe**
   - **Lynx**
   - **Lian**
   - **Ashby**
   - **Christian**

   No one has testified that any of these witnesses might lie, so we accept their statements as truthful. Therefore, they collectively assert that **Zaylee lies**.

3. **Witness Ava claims that Zaylee lies.**
   - **Witness Lucy claims that Ava lies.**
     - Since no one says that Lucy lies, we believe Lucy. Therefore, Ava is lying when she says that Zaylee lies. This means Ava's accusation against Zaylee is false, so it does not impact our assessment of Zaylee's truthfulness.

4. **Witness Lincoln claims that Zaylee lies.**
   - **Witness Jordan claims that Lincoln lies.**
     - We believe Jordan (as no one says Jordan lies), so Lincoln is lying about Zaylee. Therefore, Lincoln's accusation is false and does not affect Zaylee's credibility.

5. **Witness Christian claims that Zaylee lies.**
   - **Witness Raelynn claims that Christian lies.**
     - **Witness Callan claims that Raelynn lies.**
       - Believing Callan (as no one says Callan lies), Raelynn is lying about Christian. This means Christian is telling the truth when he says that Zaylee lies.

**Conclusion:**

- Multiple credible witnesses (Tilly, Lucas, Xanthe, Lynx, Lian, Ashby, and Christian) state that **Zaylee lies**.
- The discredited testimonies of Ava and Lincoln do not support Zaylee's credibility.
- Since trustworthy witnesses attest that Zaylee is lying when she says the wind is strong, we conclude that the **wind is not strong**.

1. **Witness Lyla says**: The sun is shining.
2. **Witnesses Perla, Juliet, Maverick, Elsie, Amayah, Azura, and Ace** claim that Lyla lies. There is no testimony against any of these witnesses, so they are to be believed.
3. **Witness Hunter claims**: Ace lies. However, **Witness Robert claims** that Hunter lies. Since no one says Robert lies, we believe Robert, which means Hunter lies. Therefore, Hunter's claim that Ace lies is false, and Ace is truthful.
4. **Witness Tanner claims**: Lyla lies. **Witness Quinn claims** that Tanner lies. **Witness Janiah claims** that Quinn lies. **Witness Amelia claims** that Janiah lies. No one says Amelia lies, so we believe her, meaning Janiah lies. Therefore, Quinn tells the truth, so Tanner lies. Thus, Tanner's claim that Lyla lies is false, and Lyla could be truthful.

1. **Adalyn** says the milk is warm.
2. **Lennon**, **Keren**, **Alani**, **Karina**, and **Serenity** all claim that **Adalyn** lies.
   - No one accuses these five witnesses of lying, so we believe them.
   - Therefore, **Adalyn** is lying about the milk being warm.
3. **Corinna** also claims that **Adalyn** lies.
   - **Harrison** claims that **Corinna** lies.
   - No one accuses **Harrison** of lying, so we believe him.
   - Therefore, **Corinna** is lying, and her statement about **Adalyn** is false (implying **Adalyn** tells the truth). However, since we've already established **Adalyn** lies based on the five trusted witnesses, **Corinna**'s false statement doesn't change the conclusion.
4. **Zane** claims that **Adalyn** lies.

   - Therefore, **Maxton** lies, so **Grace** tells the truth, meaning **Elijah** lies, so **Kailani** tells the truth, indicating **Zane** lies.
   - This means **Zane**'s claim about **Adalyn** is false, but we've already concluded **Adalyn** lies based on the five trusted witnesses.

Therefore, since the trusted witnesses agree that **Adalyn** lies about the milk being warm, the milk is not warm.

Here’s a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Kailani** says the lights are bright.

2. **Witnesses Claiming Kailani Lies**:
   - **Madelyn** says Kailani lies.
   - **Marlee** says Kailani lies.
   - **Callen** says Kailani lies.
   - **Aria** says Kailani lies.
   - **Ophelia** says Kailani lies.
   - **Ramiro** says Kailani lies.
   - **Sophia** says Kailani lies.

   *No one provides testimony that any of these witnesses might lie.* Therefore, we accept their testimonies that Kailani might be lying.

3. **Witnesses Whose Credibility is Undermined**:
   - **Eli** says Kailani lies.
     - **Kamryn** says Eli lies.
     - *Since Kamryn is not discredited by any testimony, Eli's credibility is undermined.*
   - **Ramiro** (already included above) says Kailani lies.
     - **Roman** says Ramiro lies.
       - **Austin** says Roman lies.
       - *Since Austin is not discredited, Roman's credibility is undermined, and Ramiro remains a credible witness.*

1. **Madelyn says** the chair is broken.
2. **Hannah, Mia, Sloane, Talia, and Henry** all claim that **Madelyn lies**.
   - No one accuses **Hannah, Mia, Sloane, or Talia** of lying, so we must believe them.
   - **Ella** claims that **Henry lies**, but **Elle** says that **Ella lies**.
3. **Abigail** claims that **Elle lies**.
4. **Callie** claims that **Abigail lies**.
5. **Tiana** claims that **Callie lies**.
6. **Anna** claims that **Tiana lies**.
   - No one accuses **Anna** of lying, so we believe her.
   - Since **Anna** says **Tiana lies**, **Tiana's** claim that **Callie lies** is false. Therefore, **Callie** tells the truth.
   - **Callie** says **Abigail lies**, so **Abigail** is lying when she says **Elle lies**.
   - Therefore, **Elle** tells the truth that **Ella lies**.
   - Since **Ella** lies about **Henry** lying, **Henry** tells the truth.

7. **Joseph** claims that **Aracely lies**.
   - No one accuses **Joseph** of lying, so we believe him.
   - **Aracely** claims that **Madelyn lies**, but since **Aracely** is lying, **Madelyn** tells the truth.

So we have conflicting evidence:
- **Madelyn** says the chair is broken.
- **Hannah, Mia, Sloane, Talia, and Henry** say **Madelyn lies** (implying the chair is not broken).

Since **Hannah, Mia, Sloane, Talia, and Henry** are all considered truthful (no trustworthy witness accuses them of lying), we must accept their testimony that **Madelyn lies**. Therefore, **Madelyn** is lying about the chair being broken.

Question: is the door open?
End your answer with: ""Answer: yes or no""","To determine whether the door is open, let's analyze the testimonies step by step, considering that witnesses are to be believed unless someone testifies that they might lie.

1. **Witness Lian says the door is open.**
   - By default, we believe Lian unless there's testimony suggesting otherwise.

2. **Witnesses Liam, Jack, Jovan, Suri, Eli claim that Lian lies.**
   - No one testifies that these witnesses might lie.
   - Therefore, we accept their statements as truthful.
   - This implies that Lian is lying about the door being open.

3. **Witness Rosalie claims that Lian lies.**
   - **Witness Alani claims that Rosalie lies.**
     - No one says Alani might lie.
     - Therefore, Alani is telling the truth, so Rosalie is lying.
     - Rosalie lying about Lian lying means Lian is telling the truth.
   - This creates a contradiction with the earlier conclusion that Lian is lying.

4. **Witness Owen claims that Lian lies.**
   - **Witness Emory claims that Owen lies.**
     - No one says Emory might lie.
     - Emory is telling the truth, so Owen is lying.
     - Owen lying about Lian lying implies Lian is telling the truth.
   - Again, we face a contradiction.

5. **Witness Rhett claims that Eli lies.**
   - **Witness Kynlee claims that Rhett lies.**
     - **Witness Layla claims that Kynlee lies.**
       - **Witness Callan claims that Layla lies.**
         - No one testifies that Callan might lie.
         - Callan tells the truth, so Layla is lying.
       - Layla lying about Kynlee lying means Kynlee is telling the truth.
     - Kynlee tells the truth that Rhett lies.
   - Rhett lying about Eli lying means Eli is telling the truth.
   - Eli truthfully says Lian lies, supporting the earlier witnesses.

**Conclusion:**

- The majority of uncontradicted witnesses (Liam, Jack, Jovan, Suri, Eli) state that Lian lies.
- Although Alani and Emory's testimonies suggest Lian tells the truth, accepting their statements creates contradictions that cannot be resolved without disregarding the given rules.

**Step 1: Summarize the Testimonies**

- **Amari** says the phone is ringing.
- **Zana, Nyah, Aria, Sariyah, Emory** say that **Amari** lies.
- **Maren** says that **Sariyah** lies.
- **Gianna** says that **Emory** lies.

- **Callen** says that **Easton** lies.
- **Melanie** says that **Callen** lies.
- **Elina** says that **Melanie** lies.

**Step 2: Analyze the Chain of Truth and Lies**

Starting from the end:

- **Elina** has no one accusing her of lying, so we believe her when she says **Melanie** lies.
- Since **Melanie** lies, her claim that **Callen** lies is false. So, **Callen** tells the truth.
- **Callen** tells us that **Easton** lies.
- Since **Easton** lies, his claim that **Alivia** lies is false. So, **Alivia** tells the truth.
- **Alivia** says **Janiah** lies.
- Therefore, **Janiah** lies, making her statement that **Gianna** lies false.
- So, **Gianna** tells the truth and says **Emory** lies.
- Therefore, **Emory** lies, making his claim that **Amari** lies false.
- **Maren** has no one accusing her of lying, so we believe her when she says **Sariyah** lies.
- Therefore, **Sariyah** lies, making her claim that **Amari** lies false.

**Step 3: Remaining Accusations Against Amari**

Despite discounting **Emory** and **Sariyah** (since they've been proven liars), three witnesses (**Zana, Nyah, Aria**) still claim that **Amari** lies. No one accuses these three witnesses of lying.

1. **Alayna** says the fruit is sweet.

2. **Vivienne**, **Leani**, and **Wynter** each claim that **Alayna** lies. There is no testimony against these three witnesses, so we believe them. This suggests that **Alayna** might be lying about the fruit being sweet.

3. **Ava** also claims that **Alayna** lies, but **Ian** says that **Ava** lies. Since there's no testimony against **Ian**, we believe him, which means **Ava's** testimony is suspect.

4. **Andrew** claims that **Alayna** lies, but **Tahlia** says that **Andrew** lies. With no testimony against **Tahlia**, we consider **Andrew's** testimony unreliable.

5. **Rina** claims that **Alayna** lies. However, **Brooks** says that **Rina** lies. Then, **Kenna** says that **Brooks** lies, but **Violet** claims that **Kenna** lies. **Taliah** says that **Violet** lies, and **Trenton** says that **Taliah** lies. Since there's no testimony against **Trenton**, we believe him, which makes **Taliah's** claim suspect.

Witness Jenevieve claims that witness Kaylani lies.
Witness Amity claims that witness Jenevieve lies.
Question: is the bus full?
End your answer with: ""Answer: yes or no""","To determine whether the bus is full, we'll analyze the testimonies and see which witnesses we can believe based on the provided rules:

1. **Default Trust**: Witnesses are considered truthful unless there's testimony that they might lie.
2. **Chain of Testimonies**: We'll follow the chain of accusations to see who is lying and who is truthful.

**Testimonies:**

- **Kaylee** says the bus is full.
- **Brantley**, **Devyn**, **Lux**, **Easton**, **Aurora**, **Isaiah**, and **Kaylani** claim that **Kaylee** lies.

**Accusations Against Those Who Say Kaylee Lies:**

- **Samuel** says **Easton** lies.
- **Daisy** says **Aurora** lies.
- **Maeve** says **Isaiah** lies.
- **Jenevieve** says **Kaylani** lies.

**Further Accusations:**

- **Abigail** says **Maeve** lies.
- **Amity** says **Jenevieve** lies.

**Analysis:**

1. **Witnesses Accusing Kaylee Without Being Accused:**
   - **Brantley**, **Devyn**, and **Lux** claim **Kaylee** lies.
   - No one accuses **Brantley**, **Devyn**, or **Lux** of lying.
   - Therefore, we trust **Brantley**, **Devyn**, and **Lux**.
   - Conclusion: **Kaylee** is lying.

2. **Witnesses Accused and Their Accusers:**
   - **Easton** says **Kaylee** lies.
     - **Samuel** says **Easton** lies.
     - Since **Samuel** is not accused, we believe **Samuel**, thus **Easton** is lying.
   - **Aurora** says **Kaylee** lies.
     - **Daisy** says **Aurora** lies.
     - Since **Daisy** is not accused, we believe **Daisy**, thus **Aurora** is lying.
   - **Isaiah** says **Kaylee** lies.
     - **Maeve** says **Isaiah** lies.
     - **Abigail** says **Maeve** lies.
     - Since **Abigail** is not accused, we believe **Abigail**, thus **Maeve** is lying.
     - Therefore, **Isaiah** is telling the truth.
   - **Kaylani** says **Kaylee** lies.
     - **Jenevieve** says **Kaylani** lies.
     - **Amity** says **Jenevieve** lies.
     - Since **Amity** is not accused, we believe **Amity**, thus **Jenevieve** is lying.
     - Therefore, **Kaylani** is telling the truth.

3. **Conclusion from Accused Witnesses:**
   - **Isaiah** and **Kaylani** are telling the truth (they say **Kaylee** lies).
   - **Easton** and **Aurora** are lying (their testimonies against **Kaylee** are invalid).

**Final Decision:**

- At least five trustworthy witnesses (**Brantley**, **Devyn**, **Lux**, **Isaiah**, **Kaylani**) claim **Kaylee** lies.
- Therefore, **Kaylee** is lying about the bus being full.

1. **Alexander** says the pencil is sharp.
2. **Connor**, **Liza**, **Emory**, **Bruno**, and **Callie** all claim that Alexander lies.
3. **Henry** also claims that Alexander lies, but **Rowan** claims that Henry lies. Since Rowan is unchallenged, we believe Rowan, so Henry lies, making his claim false.
4. **Oaklee** claims that Bruno lies, but **Carson** claims that Oaklee lies. Believing Carson (unchallenged), we conclude Oaklee lies, so Bruno tells the truth.
5. **Amari** claims that Callie lies, but **Zoe** claims that Amari lies. **Micah** claims that Zoe lies, but **Raelynn** claims that Micah lies. Since Raelynn is unchallenged, Micah lies, making Zoe truthful, so Amari lies, meaning Callie tells the truth.

1. **Adley** says the apples are ripe.
   
   There is testimony that Adley might lie:
   - **Elysia**, **Kyla**, and **Skye** claim that Adley lies. There is no testimony against these three witnesses, so we believe them.
   - **Liora** also claims Adley lies, but **Skylar** says Liora lies. Therefore, Liora might be lying.
   - **Leo** claims Adley lies, but **Henry** says Leo lies. **Lachlan** claims Henry lies, and **Kenna** says Lachlan lies. Since Kenna is unchallenged, Lachlan might be lying, making Henry truthful. Thus, Leo might be lying.
   - **Meadow** claims Adley lies, but **Wyatt** says Meadow lies. **Nikolas** claims Wyatt lies, and **Ruby** says Nikolas lies. Ruby is unchallenged, so Nikolas might be lying, making Wyatt truthful. Therefore, Meadow might be lying.

2. The uncontested witnesses (**Elysia**, **Kyla**, **Skye**) who claim Adley lies lead us to believe that Adley might be lying.

Since Adley might be lying about the apples being ripe, and no other trustworthy witness confirms the apples are ripe, we conclude that the apples are **not** ripe.

Question: is the cup empty?
End your answer with: ""Answer: yes or no""","To solve this puzzle, let's analyze the statements step by step, considering the rule that witnesses are believed unless there is testimony that they might lie.

1. **Adrian** says: *""The cup is empty.""*

2. **Bria** says: *""Adrian lies.""* No one accuses Bria of lying, so we believe her.

3. **Freya** says: *""Adrian lies.""* No one accuses Freya of lying, so we believe her.

4. **Aris** says: *""Adrian lies.""* **Malia** says: *""Aris lies.""* No one accuses Malia of lying, so we believe her. Therefore, Aris is lying, meaning Adrian does **not** lie according to Aris.

5. **Isaac** says: *""Adrian lies.""* **Grayson** says: *""Isaac lies.""* **Veda** says: *""Grayson lies.""* No one accuses Veda of lying, so we believe her. Therefore, Grayson is lying, so Isaac does **not** lie. Thus, Isaac tells the truth about Adrian lying.

6. **Quinn** says: *""Adrian lies.""* **Ayla** says: *""Quinn lies.""* **Zinnia** says: *""Ayla lies.""* No one accuses Zinnia of lying, so we believe her. Therefore, Ayla is lying, so Quinn does **not** lie. Thus, Quinn tells the truth about Adrian lying.

7. **Calista** says: *""Adrian lies.""* **Alana** says: *""Calista lies.""* **Ivy** says: *""Alana lies.""* No one accuses Ivy of lying, so we believe her. Therefore, Alana is lying, so Calista does **not** lie. Thus, Calista tells the truth about Adrian lying.

Question: is the garden messy?
End your answer with: ""Answer: yes or no""","To solve this reasoning puzzle, we'll analyze the testimonies given by the witnesses, following the given rule: **Witnesses should be believed unless there is testimony that they might lie.**

**Witness Azaria says that the garden is messy.**
- **Witnesses Colette, Liza, Noa, and Sarah** all claim that Azaria lies.
- Since no one accuses Colette, Liza, Noa, or Sarah of lying, we believe them.
- Therefore, Azaria is lying about the garden being messy.

Next, we consider the chain of witnesses who accuse others of lying:
- **Witness Lux** claims that Noa lies.
  - **Witness Kenna** says that Lux lies.
  - Since no one accuses Kenna of lying, we believe her, which means Lux is lying.
  - Therefore, Noa is telling the truth about Azaria lying.

Similarly, for the chain involving Sarah:
- **Witness Amelia** claims that Sarah lies.
  - **Witness Merrin** says that Amelia lies.
    - **Witness Serenity** says that Merrin lies.
      - **Witness Mallory** says that Serenity lies.
        - **Witness Mia** says that Mallory lies.
          - **Witness Saphira** says that Mia lies.
            - **Witness Kaylani** says that Saphira lies.
              - No one accuses Kaylani of lying, so we believe her, making Saphira a liar.
              - This means Mia is telling the truth, so Mallory is lying.
              - Therefore, Serenity is telling the truth, so Merrin is lying.
              - Amelia is telling the truth, so Sarah is lying about Azaria lying.

- However, since we've already established that Azaria is lying (based on the testimonies of Colette, Liza, Noa, and Sarah), and now find that Sarah is lying about Azaria lying, there seems to be a contradiction.

But, according to the rule, when a witness is accused of lying by someone we believe, we accept that they're lying. Since more witnesses (Colette, Liza, and Noa) truthfully claim that Azaria is lying and only Sarah (who's found to be lying) claims otherwise, we conclude that Azaria is indeed lying.

2. **Tinsley says Skya lies.** No one accuses Tinsley of lying, so we believe Tinsley. Therefore, Skya lies, and her statement about the fire being warm is false.
3. **Amelia also says Skya lies.** However, **Livia says Amelia lies.** Since no one accuses Livia of lying, we believe Livia. Therefore, Amelia lies about Skya lying, which would suggest Skya tells the truth. But this conflicts with Tinsley's unchallenged testimony.
4. **Kaylin says Skya lies.** **Anna says Kaylin lies.** **Yara says Anna lies.** **Malia says Yara lies.** **Kaylani says Malia lies.** **Felicity says Kaylani lies.** **Leila says Felicity lies.** **Zafira says Leila lies.** **Ethan says Zafira lies.** **Oakley says Ethan lies.**
   - Oakley is unchallenged, so we believe Oakley: Ethan lies.
   - Therefore, Zafira tells the truth: Leila lies.
   - Therefore, Felicity tells the truth: Kaylani lies.
   - Therefore, Malia tells the truth: Yara lies.
   - Therefore, Anna tells the truth: Kaylin lies.
   - Therefore, Kaylin lies about Skya lying, supporting the idea that Skya tells the truth.

Despite the chain that suggests Skya tells the truth, Tinsley's unchallenged testimony that Skya lies cannot be ignored. Since witnesses are believed unless discredited, and Tinsley's testimony stands, we must conclude that Skya lies.

Question: is the milk spoiled?
End your answer with: ""Answer: yes or no""","To solve this reasoning puzzle, we'll follow the given conventions: witnesses are believed unless there's testimony that they might lie.

1. **Witness Statements**:
   - **Aubrey**: The milk is spoiled.
   - **Adley**: Aubrey lies.
   - **Kassidy**: Aubrey lies.
   - **Olivia**: Kassidy lies.
   - **Anwen**: Aubrey lies.
   - **Soraya**: Anwen lies.
   - **Harlow**: Aubrey lies.
   - **Leah**: Harlow lies.
   - **Salvador**: Leah lies.
   - **Samantha**: Salvador lies.
   - **Fiera**: Samantha lies.
   - **Anna**: Fiera lies.
   - **Tori**: Anna lies.
   - **Zalia**: Tori lies.

2. **Identifying Unchallenged Witnesses**:
   - **Adley**: No one says Adley lies.
   - **Olivia**: No one says Olivia lies.
   - **Soraya**: No one says Soraya lies.
   - **Zalia**: No one says Zalia lies.

3. **Analyzing Testimonies**:
   - **Adley says Aubrey lies**: Since no one challenges Adley, we believe Adley. Therefore, **Aubrey lies** about the milk being spoiled.
   - **Olivia says Kassidy lies**: Kassidy said Aubrey lies, but Olivia (unchallenged) says Kassidy lies. Therefore, **Kassidy is lying**, and Aubrey might be telling the truth.
   - **Soraya says Anwen lies**: Anwen said Aubrey lies, but Soraya (unchallenged) says Anwen lies. Therefore, **Anwen is lying**, suggesting Aubrey tells the truth.
   - **Zalia says Tori lies**, starting a chain that ultimately suggests Aubrey tells the truth.

4. **Resolving Conflicts**:
   - **Adley's unchallenged testimony** directly states that Aubrey lies.
   - Although Olivia and Soraya's testimonies suggest that Aubrey tells the truth, they are addressing witnesses (Kassidy and Anwen) who challenge Aubrey, not Aubrey directly.
   - Since **Adley's direct and unchallenged claim** is about Aubrey lying, it holds more weight.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - According to Adley, Aubrey lies, and there's no testimony against Adley.
   - Therefore, Aubrey's claim that the milk is spoiled is false.

Question: is the store open?
End your answer with: ""Answer: yes or no""","To determine whether the store is open, we'll analyze each witness statement based on the principle that witnesses should be believed unless there is testimony that they might lie.

1. **Camila** says the store is open.
2. **Parker** claims Camila lies.
   - **Santiago** claims Parker lies.
     - Since no one says Santiago lies, we believe Santiago.
     - Therefore, Parker lies, so Camila does not lie (from Parker's false claim).
3. **Mateo** claims Camila lies.
   - **Philomena** claims Mateo lies.
     - No one says Philomena lies, so we believe her.
     - Therefore, Mateo lies, so Camila does not lie (from Mateo's false claim).
4. **Theo** claims Camila lies.
   - **Hannah** claims Theo lies.
     - **Lavinia** claims Hannah lies.
       - **Taliah** claims Lavinia lies.
         - No one claims Taliah lies, so we believe her.
         - Therefore, Lavinia lies, meaning Hannah tells the truth.
     - Therefore, Hannah tells the truth, so Theo lies, and Camila does not lie (from Theo's false claim).
5. **Calia** claims Camila lies.
   - **Rhett** claims Calia lies.
     - **Beckham** claims Rhett lies.
       - **Azura** claims Beckham lies.
         - **Riley** claims Azura lies.
           - No one claims Riley lies, so we believe her.
           - Therefore, Azura lies, meaning Beckham tells the truth.
       - Beckham tells the truth, so Rhett lies.
     - Rhett lies, so Calia does not lie.
   - Calia tells the truth when she says Camila lies.

Since Calia truthfully claims that Camila lies, we conclude that Camila is lying about the store being open.

Witness Gabriel claims that witness Farrah lies.
Witness Gracie claims that witness Gabriel lies.
Question: is the teacher speaking?
End your answer with: ""Answer: yes or no""","To solve this puzzle, we'll consider each witness's statements and determine whether they are telling the truth or lying, based on the given rule: witnesses should be believed unless there is testimony that they might lie.

1. **Witnesses Without Accusations (Assumed Truthful)**:
   - **Joshua**: Claims William lies.
   - **Renata**: Claims Angel lies.
   - **Lillian**: Claims Kamryn lies.
   - **Gracie**: Claims Gabriel lies.

2. **Determining the Status of Other Witnesses**:
   - **William**:
     - Since Joshua (truthful) says William lies, **William is lying**.
     - William claims Zada lies; since he lies, his statement is false. Therefore, **Zada is truthful**.
   - **Angel**:
     - Renata (truthful) says Angel lies, so **Angel is lying**.
     - Angel claims Marlee lies; since she lies, her statement is false. Therefore, **Marlee is truthful**.
   - **Marlee**:
     - Marlee claims Zada lies; since she is truthful, **Zada is lying**.
     - This contradicts our earlier conclusion that Zada is truthful.
   - **Kamryn**:
     - Lillian (truthful) says Kamryn lies, so **Kamryn is lying**.
     - Kamryn claims Soraya lies; since she lies, her statement is false. Therefore, **Soraya is truthful**.
   - **Anwen and Soraya**:
     - Soraya (truthful) says Anwen lies, so **Anwen is lying**.
     - Anwen claims Zada lies; since she lies, her statement is false. Therefore, **Zada is truthful** (reinforcing our earlier conclusion).
   - **Gabriel**:
     - Gracie (truthful) says Gabriel lies, so **Gabriel is lying**.
     - Gabriel claims Farrah lies; since he lies, his statement is false. Therefore, **Farrah is truthful**.
   - **Farrah and Liana**:
     - Farrah (truthful) says Liana lies, so **Liana is lying**.
     - Liana claims Zada lies; since she lies, her statement is false. Therefore, **Zada is truthful**.

3. **Resolving the Contradiction with Marlee**:
   - Since Marlee (truthful) says Zada lies, but all other evidence suggests Zada is truthful, there is a contradiction.
   - The only resolution is that our assumption about Marlee being truthful is incorrect.
   - Re-evaluating, Marlee can’t be truthful if it leads to a contradiction with the majority of evidence.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - **Zada is telling the truth** when she says the teacher is speaking.
   - Therefore, **the teacher is speaking**.

Question: is the sky blue?
End your answer with: ""Answer: yes or no""","To determine if the sky is blue, we need to assess the credibility of Witness Mira's statement that ""the sky is blue,"" considering the testimonies about whether she and others might lie.

1. **Witness Mira says the sky is blue.**
   - **Testimony that Mira might lie:**
     - **Charlie** says ""Mira lies.""
     - **Layna** says ""Mira lies.""
     - **Sarah** says ""Mira lies.""
   - Unless these witnesses are discredited, we must consider that Mira might lie.

2. **Assessing the credibility of those who say Mira lies:**

   - **Charlie:**
     - **Ashby** says ""Charlie lies.""
     - **Wynter** says ""Ashby lies.""
     - **No one says Wynter lies;** thus, Wynter is credible, and Ashby might lie.
     - Since Ashby might lie, we cannot trust Ashby's claim that Charlie lies.
     - **No other testimony against Charlie;** thus, Charlie is credible.

   - **Layna:**
     - **Etta** says ""Layna lies.""
     - **Ruby** says ""Etta lies.""
     - **No one says Ruby lies;** thus, Ruby is credible, and Etta might lie.
     - Since Etta might lie, we cannot trust Etta's claim that Layna lies.
     - **No other testimony against Layna;** thus, Layna is credible.

   - **Sarah:**
     - **Elira** says ""Sarah lies.""
     - **Micah** says ""Elira lies.""
     - **Briar** says ""Micah lies.""
     - **Ayla** says ""Briar lies.""
     - **Lydia** says ""Ayla lies.""
     - **Ramiro** says ""Lydia lies.""
     - **No one says Ramiro lies;** thus, Ramiro is credible, and Lydia might lie.
     - Since Lydia might lie, we cannot trust Lydia's claim that Ayla lies, making Ayla credible.
     - Following this chain back, **Micah is credible**, making Elira might lie, and thus Sarah is credible.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - Credible witnesses **Charlie, Layna, and Sarah** claim that **Mira lies**.
   - Therefore, Mira might lie, and we cannot trust her statement that the sky is blue.
   - No credible evidence supports that the sky is blue.

**Given Rules:**
- Witnesses are to be believed unless there is testimony that they might lie.

Let's list the witnesses and their statements:

1. **Corinna (C)**: Says that the car is fast.
2. **Aniyah (A)**: Claims that Corinna lies.
3. **Reagan (R)**: Claims that Aniyah lies.
4. **Gianna (G)**: Claims that Reagan lies.

12. **Grayson (N)**: Claims that Wren lies.
13. **Ruby (U)**: Claims that Grayson lies.
14. **Elysia (Y)**: Claims that Ruby lies.

We'll analyze the chains of testimonies to see who is truthful and who is lying.

---

### **First Chain:**

- **Corinna (C)** says: *""The car is fast.""*
- **Aniyah (A)** says: *""Corinna lies.""* So, if Aniyah is telling the truth, then Corinna is lying.
- **Reagan (R)** says: *""Aniyah lies.""* So, if Reagan is telling the truth, then Aniyah is lying.
- **Gianna (G)** says: *""Reagan lies.""* So, if Gianna is telling the truth, then Reagan is lying.

**Assuming Gianna is telling the truth:**

- **Gianna (G)** is truthful ⇒ **Reagan (R)** is lying.
- **Reagan (R)** lies about Aniyah lying ⇒ **Aniyah (A)** is truthful.
- **Aniyah (A)** says Corinna lies ⇒ **Corinna (C)** is lying.
- **Corinna (C)** lies about the car being fast ⇒ The car is **not fast**.

---

### **Second Chain:**

- **Lennon (L)** says: *""Corinna lies.""*
- **Sophia (S)** says: *""Lennon lies.""*
- **Jeremiah (J)** says: *""Sophia lies.""*
- **Greyson (Y)** says: *""Jeremiah lies.""*

**Assuming Greyson is telling the truth:**

- **Greyson (Y)** is truthful ⇒ **Jeremiah (J)** is lying.
- **Jeremiah (J)** lies about Sophia lying ⇒ **Sophia (S)** is truthful.
- **Sophia (S)** says Lennon lies ⇒ **Lennon (L)** is lying.
- **Lennon (L)** lies about Corinna lying ⇒ **Corinna (C)** is truthful.
- **Corinna (C)** says the car is fast ⇒ The car is **fast**.

---

### **Third Chain:**

- **Parker (P)** says: *""Corinna lies.""*
- **Eva (E)** says: *""Parker lies.""*
- **Wren (W)** says: *""Eva lies.""*
- **Grayson (N)** says: *""Wren lies.""*
- **Ruby (U)** says: *""Grayson lies.""*
- **Elysia (Y)** says: *""Ruby lies.""*

**Assuming Elysia is telling the truth:**

- **Elysia (Y)** is truthful ⇒ **Ruby (U)** is lying.
- **Ruby (U)** lies about Grayson lying ⇒ **Grayson (N)** is truthful.
- **Grayson (N)** says Wren lies ⇒ **Wren (W)** is lying.
- **Wren (W)** lies about Eva lying ⇒ **Eva (E)** is truthful.
- **Eva (E)** says Parker lies ⇒ **Parker (P)** is lying.
- **Parker (P)** lies about Corinna lying ⇒ **Corinna (C)** is truthful.
- **Corinna (C)** says the car is fast ⇒ The car is **fast**.

---

### **Resolving the Contradiction:**

We have two conclusions:

1. **First Chain** suggests the car is **not fast**.
2. **Second and Third Chains** suggest the car **is fast**.

**Conflict Resolution:**

- **Witness Credibility:** According to the rules, witnesses are to be believed unless there's testimony they might lie.
- **Gianna's Position:** No one testifies that Gianna lies, so initially, we consider her truthful. However, this leads to a contradiction with the other chains where multiple witnesses (backed by testimonies) support that Corinna is truthful.
- **Consistency Priority:** To resolve the contradiction and maintain consistency across all testimonies, we need to reassess Gianna's truthfulness.
  
**Reassessing Gianna:**

- Assuming **Gianna is lying** (even without explicit testimony against her) allows all chains to consistently conclude that Corinna tells the truth and the car is fast.
- This adjustment aligns with the majority of testimonies and maintains overall consistency.

---

**Final Conclusion:**

- **Corinna (C)** is truthful ⇒ The car is **fast**.

Witness Tahlia claims that witness Sylvie lies.

Question: is the soup salty?
End your answer with: ""Answer: yes or no""","To solve this reasoning puzzle, let's carefully analyze the statements and apply the given rule: witnesses should be believed unless there is testimony that they might lie.

1. **Kyra** says that the soup is salty.
   
2. **Carson** claims that **Kyra** lies.
   - Since there's no testimony that **Carson** might lie, we initially believe **Carson**, which suggests **Kyra** is lying.
   
3. **Imani** claims that **Kyra** lies.
   - Similarly, we believe **Imani**, reinforcing the idea that **Kyra** is lying.
   
4. **Matthew** claims that **Kyra** lies.
   - We believe **Matthew** unless proven otherwise.
   
5. **Elaine** claims that **Matthew** lies.
   - We believe **Elaine**, so **Matthew** is lying. This means **Matthew's** claim about **Kyra** lying is false, suggesting **Kyra** tells the truth.
   
At this point, we have conflicting testimonies:
- **Carson** and **Imani** say **Kyra** lies.
- **Elaine's** testimony leads us to conclude **Kyra** tells the truth.

However, the chain continues:

6. **Kaylin** claims that **Elaine** lies.
   - We believe **Kaylin**, which means **Elaine** is lying. So, **Matthew** is actually telling the truth, and **Kyra** is lying.
   
7. **Jayce** claims that **Kaylin** lies.
   - Believing **Jayce** means **Kaylin** is lying, so **Elaine** tells the truth. Therefore, **Matthew** is lying, and **Kyra** tells the truth.
   
This pattern continues, with each subsequent witness claiming the previous one lies. Through this chain, the truth about **Kyra** alternates:

- **Odd-numbered** witnesses in the chain beyond **Matthew** (like **Kaylin**, **Josiah**, **Brooklyn**, etc.) lead us to conclude **Kyra** is lying.
- **Even-numbered** witnesses (like **Jayce**, **Victoria**, **Hunter**, etc.) lead us to conclude **Kyra** tells the truth.

The final witness in the chain is **Calista**:

15. **Calista** claims that **Tahlia** lies.
    - Since there's no testimony against **Calista**, we believe her. This means **Tahlia** lies, so **Sylvie** tells the truth, and we follow this back through the chain to conclude **Kyra** tells the truth.

With **Calista's** testimony, the chain ends on an **even number**, leading us to conclude that **Kyra** is telling the truth and the soup is salty.

Regarding **Carson** and **Imani**:
- While no one explicitly says they might lie, the logical inconsistency forces us to reassess their testimonies.
- Since believing them leads to a contradiction (both **Kyra** lying and telling the truth), we conclude that they must be lying.

**Analysis:**

Starting from the last witness and working backward:

- **Devyn** is the last witness, and there's no testimony against Devyn. So, we **believe** Devyn when she says that **Daniel lies**.
  
- Since **Daniel lies**, his statement that **Briella lies** is false. Therefore, **Briella** tells the truth when she says that **Alistair lies**.

- Since **Alistair lies** (as per Briella), his statement that **Jaxon lies** is false. Therefore, **Jaxon** tells the truth when he says that **Penelope lies**.

- Since **Penelope lies** (as per Jaxon), her statement that **Kelsey lies** is false. Therefore, **Kelsey** tells the truth when she says that **Sylvie lies**.

- Since **Sylvie lies** (as per Kelsey), her statement that **Faye lies** is false. Therefore, **Faye** tells the truth when she says that **Ellie lies**.

- Since **Ellie lies** (as per Faye), her statement that **Taliah lies** is false. Therefore, **Taliah** tells the truth when she says that **Kai lies**.

- Since **Kai lies** (as per Taliah), his statement that the cup is empty is false.

**Conclusion:**

Given the above reasoning, **Kai is lying** when he says the cup is empty. Therefore, **the cup is not empty**.

14. **Jovie** says that **Aveline lies**.
15. **Calliope** says that **Jovie lies**.

**Rule:** Witnesses are **considered honest** unless there is testimony that they might lie.

**Analysis:**

1. **Witnesses Without Accusations of Lying:**
   - **Jaxon**, **Maylin**, **Charles**, **Jada**, **Elsie**, **Maverick**, and **Calliope** have **no one** saying they lie.
   - According to the rule, they are **honest**.

2. **Witnesses Accused of Lying:**
   - **Ella** is accused of lying by **Jaxon**, **Maylin**, **Charles**, **Jada**, **Elsie**, **Maverick**, and **Azalea**.
   - **Azalea** is accused of lying by **Quincy**.
   - **Quincy** is accused of lying by **Rosalie**.
   - **Rosalie** is accused by **Layne**, and so on down the chain.

3. **Determining Ella's Honesty:**
   - Since **trusted witnesses** (**Jaxon**, **Maylin**, **Charles**, **Jada**, **Elsie**, **Maverick**) say that **Ella lies**, Ella must be **lying**.
   - Therefore, **Ella's claim that the plane is landing is false**.

4. **Chain of Accusations Beyond Ella:**
   - **Calliope** is **honest** and says **Jovie lies**.
   - **Jovie** is then lying when she says **Aveline lies**.
   - Since **Jovie lies**, **Aveline** is **honest**.
   - This pattern continues, but since **Ella** has already been determined to be **lying** based on trusted witnesses, the plane is **not landing**.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the truthful witnesses and the rules provided, **Ella is lying about the plane landing**. The plane is, therefore, **not landing**.

2. **Witnesses Bruno, Luke, Parker, Melanie, Angel, Angela, Teagan, Maverick, Summer, Lucian, Maren, Ayla, and Zoe** claim that **Witness Roman lies**.
3. **Witness Thomas** claims that **Witness Zoe lies**.

According to the given rule: *Witnesses should be believed unless there is testimony that they might lie.*

- **Witness Thomas** says **Witness Zoe lies**, so we have testimony that Zoe might lie. Therefore, we should not trust Zoe's claim that Roman lies.
- For the other witnesses (Bruno to Ayla), there is no testimony suggesting they might lie. Therefore, we must believe their claims that Roman lies.

Since multiple trusted witnesses (excluding Zoe) claim that Roman lies, we conclude that Roman is lying about the child laughing.

**Facts:**
1. **Angela** says the music is loud.
2. **12 witnesses** (Melody, Zana, Liora, Ella, Christian, Reyna, Xanthe, Anna, Ashlynn, Angel, Briar, Zaniyah) claim that **Angela lies**.
3. **Roslyn** claims that **Briar lies**.
4. **Josie** claims that **Zaniyah lies**.

**Analysis:**
- **Angela** claims the music is loud. We would believe her unless there is testimony that she might lie.
- **12 witnesses** claim that **Angela lies**. We should believe these witnesses unless there is testimony that they might lie.
- **Roslyn** provides testimony that **Briar lies**, so **Briar's** claim may not be credible.
- **Josie** provides testimony that **Zaniyah lies**, so **Zaniyah's** claim may not be credible.
- This leaves **10 witnesses** (excluding Briar and Zaniyah) who claim **Angela lies** without any testimony against them.
- Since there's no testimony suggesting these 10 witnesses might lie, we believe them over Angela.
- Therefore, **Angela is lying** when she says the music is loud.

Question: is the sky cloudy?
End your answer with: ""Answer: yes or no""","To determine whether the sky is cloudy, we need to analyze the statements of the witnesses.

1. **Max says that the sky is cloudy.**

2. **Multiple witnesses (Lyric, Orion, Aris, Paisley, Isaiah, Mira, Noah, Aniyah) claim that Max lies.** None of these witnesses are accused of lying by anyone else. According to the given rules, witnesses should be believed unless there is testimony that they might lie. Therefore, we can accept their statements and conclude that Max lies.

3. **Emmeline also claims that Max lies.** However, **Kamara claims that Emmeline lies.** Since no one accuses Kamara of lying, we believe Kamara. Therefore, Emmeline lies when she says Max lies, which means Max tells the truth according to her.

4. **Lizbeth claims that Max lies.** **Levi claims that Lizbeth lies.** **Elijah claims that Levi lies,** but **Stella claims that Elijah lies.** Since no one accuses Stella of lying, we believe her, which means Elijah lies about Levi lying. Therefore, Levi tells the truth when he says Lizbeth lies. This means Lizbeth lies when she says Max lies, indicating that Max tells the truth according to her.

5. Despite Emmeline and Lizbeth lying about Max, we have **eight unchallenged witnesses (Lyric, Orion, Aris, Paisley, Isaiah, Mira, Noah, Aniyah)** who claim that Max lies. Since there's no testimony that they might lie, we accept their statements.

Witness Ayleen claims that witness Elina lies.
Question: is the door locked?
End your answer with: ""Answer: yes or no""","To solve this reasoning puzzle, we'll analyze the witnesses' statements and determine whether the door is locked.

Firstly, we have:

- **Malia** says: *""The door is locked.""*
- **Witnesses who claim Malia lies**:
  - **Leonardo**
  - **Tahlia**
  - **Jenna**
  - **Sable**
  - **Jaylani**
  - **Keren**
  - **Julian**
  - **Amira**
  - **Lux**
  - **Rhett**
  - **Elina**

However, some witnesses' credibility is challenged:

- **Rosalie** says: *""Lux lies.""*
- **Layna** says: *""Rhett lies.""*
- **Ayleen** says: *""Elina lies.""*

According to the puzzle's rule:
- **Witnesses should be believed unless there is testimony that they might lie.**

Let's assess each witness:

1. **Witnesses accusing Malia of lying**:
   - **Leonardo, Tahlia, Jenna, Sable, Jaylani, Keren, Julian, and Amira** all claim Malia lies.
   - **No one accuses these witnesses of lying**, so we accept their statements as true.
   - Therefore, **Malia is lying** about the door being locked.

2. **Witnesses whose credibility is challenged**:
   - **Lux** says Malia lies, but **Rosalie** (who isn't accused of lying) says Lux lies.
     - So, Lux is lying, meaning her claim that Malia lies is false.
     - This would suggest Malia tells the truth, conflicting with the earlier conclusion.
   - **Rhett** says Malia lies, but **Layna** says Rhett lies.
     - So, Rhett is lying, so his claim that Malia lies is false.
     - Again, this suggests Malia tells the truth, conflicting with previous findings.
   - **Elina** says Malia lies, but **Ayleen** says Elina lies.
     - So, Elina is lying, so her claim that Malia lies is false.
     - This also suggests Malia tells the truth.

**Reconciliation of the conflict**:
- The contradiction arises because believing both the unchallenged witnesses and the implications of the challenged ones leads to inconsistency.
- Since the rule prioritizes believing witnesses unless they might lie, and because more unchallenged witnesses (eight in total) claim Malia lies, we accept that Malia is lying.
- The challenged witnesses (Lux, Rhett, Elina) do not overturn this because their own credibility is invalidated.

**Conclusion**:
- **Malia is lying** about the door being locked.
- Therefore, **the door is not locked**.

   - Callan says **Tilly** lies.
   - Charlotte says **Callan** lies.

**Step-by-step analysis**:

- **Witnesses are presumed truthful unless there's testimony that they might lie.**

**Analyzing the witnesses:**

- **Alice, Leonardo, Reagan, Liza, Lillian, Brooks, Everett**:
  - All claim that **Isla lies**.
  - There is no testimony against them.
  - **We believe them**.

- **Kinsley**:
  - Claims **Isla lies**.
  - **Liora** says **Kinsley lies**.
  - There is no testimony against **Liora**.
  - **We believe Liora**, so **Kinsley is lying**.

- **Kai**:
  - Claims **Isla lies**.
  - **Arlo** says **Kai lies**.
  - There is no testimony against **Arlo**.
  - **We believe Arlo**, so **Kai is lying**.

- **Tilly**:

  - **Callan** says **Tilly lies**.
  - **Charlotte** says **Callan lies**.
  - There is no testimony against **Charlotte**.
  - **We believe Charlotte**, so **Callan is lying**.
  - Since **Callan** lies about **Tilly** lying, **Tilly is telling the truth**.

**Conclusion**:

- **Isla** says the house is big, but **8 truthful witnesses** (Alice, Leonardo, Reagan, Liza, Lillian, Brooks, Everett, Tilly) say **Isla lies**.
- **Kinsley and Kai** are lying when they say **Isla lies**.
- Since the majority of trustworthy witnesses claim **Isla lies**, **we conclude that Isla is lying**.

Question: is the book heavy?
End your answer with: ""Answer: yes or no""","To solve this puzzle, we'll determine who is telling the truth and who is lying based on the given testimonies and the rule: witnesses should be believed unless there's testimony that they might lie.

1. **Witness Brantley says the book is heavy.**

2. **Witnesses Asher, Matthew, Rhett, and Liana** say that **Brantley lies**. There is no testimony that any of these four witnesses might lie, so we accept their statements as truthful. Therefore, **Brantley is lying**, and the book is not heavy.

3. **Witness Orion** says that **Brantley lies**, but **Witness Callie** says that **Orion lies**. Since there's no testimony that Callie might lie, we believe her. Therefore, **Orion is lying**, making his statement false, so according to Orion (who is lying), Brantley does not lie. However, this doesn't affect our earlier conclusion based on the four truthful witnesses.

4. **Witness Olivia** says that **Brantley lies**, but **Witness Penelope** says that **Olivia lies**. With no testimony against Penelope, we conclude that **Olivia is lying**, so her claim that Brantley lies is false.

5. **Witness Saia** says that **Brantley lies**, but **Witness Kyson** says that **Saia lies**. Without testimony against Kyson, we determine that **Saia is lying**, so her statement about Brantley is false.

6. **Witness Isaiah** says that **Brantley lies**. **Witness Saphira** says that **Isaiah lies**, but **Witness Kennedy** claims that **Saphira lies**. **Witness Olwen** then says that **Kennedy lies**. There's no testimony against Olwen, so we trust her, which means **Kennedy is lying**, so **Saphira is telling the truth**, making **Isaiah a liar**.

In summary, the truthful witnesses (Asher, Matthew, Rhett, Liana) confirm that **Brantley lies** about the book being heavy. The other witnesses who accuse Brantley of lying are themselves proven liars, but this doesn't negate the conclusion reached by the truthful witnesses.

Question: is the pencil sharp?
End your answer with: ""Answer: yes or no""","To determine whether the pencil is sharp, we need to evaluate the credibility of the witnesses based on the provided facts and the rule that witnesses are believed unless there is testimony that they might lie.

1. **Imani** says the pencil is sharp.

2. **Keely**, **Zana**, **Connor**, **Ember**, and **Claire** each claim that **Imani** lies. There is no testimony against these witnesses, so we have no reason to doubt them. Therefore, we accept that **Imani** lies about the pencil being sharp.

3. **Skye** also claims that **Imani** lies. However, **Nova** claims that **Skye** lies. 

   - **Elowen** claims that **Nova** lies.
   - **Jenna** claims that **Elowen** lies.
   - There is no testimony against **Jenna**, so we accept that **Elowen** lies, which means **Nova** is telling the truth about **Skye** lying.
   - Therefore, **Skye** lies when saying **Imani** lies, but since we have multiple other witnesses (unrebutted) stating **Imani** lies, this does not change our conclusion about **Imani**.

4. **Jamiya** claims that **Claire** lies.
   - **Talia** claims that **Jamiya** lies.
   - **Rayna** claims that **Talia** lies.
   - **Aracely** claims that **Rayna** lies.
   - **Arwen** claims that **Aracely** lies.
   - Since there is no testimony against **Arwen**, we accept that **Aracely** lies, meaning **Rayna** tells the truth, indicating **Talia** lies, which means **Jamiya** tells the truth, suggesting **Claire** lies. However, with both truths and lies in this chain, and no testimony against the initial witnesses who claim **Imani** lies, the conclusion remains that **Imani** lies.

**Conclusion**: The witnesses collectively provide sufficient unrebutted testimony that **Imani** lies about the pencil being sharp. Therefore, we conclude that the pencil is not sharp.

Question: is the dog happy?
End your answer with: ""Answer: yes or no""","To determine whether the dog is happy, we'll analyze the testimonies step by step, following the rule that witnesses are believed unless there's testimony that they might lie.

1. **Layne says the dog is happy.** However, multiple witnesses claim that Layne lies:

   - None of these four witnesses are accused of lying by anyone credible.
   
2. **Lyric also claims that Layne lies**, but:
   - **Rowan** says that Lyric lies.
   - No one accuses Rowan of lying, so we believe Rowan, which discredits Lyric's testimony.
   
3. **Melanie claims that Austin lies**, trying to discredit his testimony against Layne. However:

**Key Points:**

1. **Witness Sadira states that the book is heavy.**
2. **Witnesses Aaron, Maxine, and Chloe claim that Sadira lies.**
   - **No one claims that Aaron, Maxine, or Chloe lie.**
3. **According to the rule, since there's testimony that Sadira might lie (from Aaron, Maxine, and Chloe), we should not believe Sadira.**
4. **Other witnesses (Stella, Holden, Merrin, Greer) also claim that Sadira lies, but they are themselves accused of lying by other witnesses.**

**Conclusion:**

- Since Aaron, Maxine, and Chloe are credible witnesses (no one has accused them of lying), and they state that Sadira lies, we should accept that Sadira might be lying.
- Therefore, we should not believe Sadira's claim that the book is heavy.
- There is no credible testimony claiming that the book is heavy apart from Sadira's statement.

**Witnesses claiming Sarah lies (unchallenged):**
- Brielle
- Connor
- Lyla
- Aaron

These witnesses claim Sarah lies, and no one has testified that they might lie. Therefore, their testimonies stand, and Sarah is considered to possibly be lying.

**Witnesses whose accusations are challenged:**
- Bella (accused by Mabel)
- Evan (accused by Quincy)
- Norah (accused by Max)
- Leani (accused by Dominic)

Since these witnesses are accused of lying by others who are not themselves accused of lying, their testimonies that Sarah lies are unreliable.

**Conclusion:**
With four unchallenged witnesses stating that Sarah lies, we have sufficient reason to doubt Sarah's claim. Therefore, we conclude that Sarah is lying, and the dog is not barking.

End your answer with: ""Answer: yes or no""","To solve this puzzle, we need to determine whether the air is fresh based on the witnesses' testimonies. The key rule is:

- **Witnesses should be believed unless there is testimony that they might lie.**

First, let's list the witnesses and their statements:

1. **Anwen** says: *The air is fresh.*
2. **Wren** says: *Anwen lies.*
3. **Zuri** says: *Anwen lies.*
4. **Harper** says: *Anwen lies.*

13. **Sable** says: *Sebastian lies.*
14. **Kenna** says: *Sable lies.*
15. **Mira** says: *Kenna lies.*

Now, let's analyze the credibility of each witness based on whether there is testimony that they might lie:

- **Anwen** is accused of lying by **Wren**, **Zuri**, **Harper**, **Corinna**, **Liana**, **Tahlia**, and **Sebastian**.
  
  - **Wren**, **Zuri**, **Harper**, and **Corinna** have no testimony against them, so they are credible. Therefore, we believe their statements that Anwen lies.
  
  - **Liana** is said to lie by **Tinsley**. Since **Tinsley** has no testimony against her, **Liana** is discredited. We cannot trust **Liana**'s claim that Anwen lies.
  
  - **Tahlia** is said to lie by **Willow**, who is credible. Thus, **Tahlia** is discredited, and we cannot trust her claim that Anwen lies.
  
  - **Sebastian** is said to lie by **Sable**. **Sable** is said to lie by **Kenna**, who is said to lie by **Mira**, who is credible. Therefore, **Kenna** is discredited, meaning **Sable** remains credible. Thus, **Sebastian** is discredited, and we cannot trust his claim that Anwen lies.

- Therefore, credible witnesses (**Wren**, **Zuri**, **Harper**, **Corinna**) state that **Anwen** lies. Since there is credible testimony against **Anwen**, we conclude that **Anwen** is lying.

1. **Witness Saia says that the grass is green.**

2. **Witnesses Tori and Liana claim that Saia lies.**
   - There is no testimony suggesting that Tori or Liana might lie.
   - Therefore, we believe Tori and Liana when they say Saia lies.

3. **Witness Alessia claims that Saia lies, but Witness Adam claims that Alessia lies.**
   - Adam's testimony indicates that Alessia might lie.
   - Therefore, we cannot trust Alessia's claim about Saia.

4. **Witness Madison claims that Saia lies, but Witness Lainey claims that Madison lies.**
   - Lainey's testimony suggests that Madison might lie.
   - Since there is no testimony that Lainey lies, we trust Lainey.

13. **Farrah** claims that Lian lies.
14. **Adira** claims that Farrah lies.
15. **Savannah** claims that Adira lies.

**Now, apply the rules step by step:**

- **Unchallenged Witnesses:** Witnesses not accused of lying are assumed to tell the truth.
  - **Kailani** and **Elsie** are unchallenged and claim that **Miles lies**.
  - **Amelia** is unchallenged and claims that **Tessa lies**.
  - **Eithne** is unchallenged and claims that **Perla lies**.
  - **Savannah** is unchallenged and claims that **Adira lies**.

**Determine the truthfulness of other witnesses based on unchallenged testimonies:**

1. **From Eithne's statement:**
   - **Perla** lies (since Eithne says so).
   - **Perla** claimed that **Miles lies**, but since **Perla** lies, **Miles** could be telling the truth.

2. **From Amelia's statement:**
   - **Tessa** lies (since Amelia says so).
   - **Tessa** claimed that **Miles lies**, but since **Tessa** lies, **Miles** could be telling the truth.

3. **From Savannah's statement and the chain of accusations:**
   - **Adira** lies (since Savannah says so).
   - **Adira** claimed that **Farrah** lies, so **Farrah** tells the truth.
   - **Farrah** says **Lian** lies, so **Lian** lies.
   - **Lian** claimed that **Jeremiah** lies, so **Jeremiah** tells the truth.
   - **Jeremiah** says **Liza** lies, so **Liza** lies.
   - **Liza** claimed that **Janiah** lies, so **Janiah** tells the truth.
   - **Janiah** says **Lorelei** lies, so **Lorelei** lies.
   - **Lorelei** claimed that **Miles lies**, but since **Lorelei** lies, **Miles** could be telling the truth.

**Analyze the conflicting evidence:**

- **Kailani** and **Elsie** (both unchallenged) claim that **Miles lies**.
- Through the chain starting with **Eithne**, we find reasons to believe that **Miles** tells the truth.
- There's a contradiction between the unchallenged witnesses' statements.

**Conclusion:**

Given that the unchallenged witnesses **Kailani** and **Elsie** claim that **Miles lies**, and there's no evidence against their credibility, we accept their statements.

**Analysis:**

- **Eloise** and **Lincoln** both say that Azaria lies and **are not** accused of lying by anyone else. According to the instructions, we should believe them.
- Since there's credible testimony that Azaria might lie, we should not believe Azaria's statement that the house is big.
- The other witnesses who accuse Azaria (**Quinn**, **Austin**, **Ember**, and **Aviana**) are themselves accused of lying, so their credibility is questionable.
- The chain of accusations beyond **Aviana** does not impact the credibility of **Eloise** and **Lincoln**.

Question: is the milk spoiled?
End your answer with: ""Answer: yes or no""","To determine if the milk is spoiled, we need to assess which witnesses are telling the truth based on the given rules:

1. **Witnesses are believed unless there is testimony that they might lie.**
2. **Witnesses accusing others introduces doubt about the accused's honesty.**

Here's the step-by-step analysis:

- **Lachlan** says the **milk is spoiled**.
- **Tatum** and **Joseph** claim that **Lachlan lies**. No one accuses Tatum or Joseph of lying, so they are truthful. Therefore, **Lachlan is lying** about the milk being spoiled.
  
For the other witnesses who claim that Lachlan lies:

- **Lian** says **Lachlan lies**, but **Adrian** says **Lian lies**. Since no one accuses Adrian of lying, Adrian is truthful, making Lian a liar. Therefore, Lian's claim about Lachlan is false.
  
- **Ivy** says **Lachlan lies**, but **Camille** says **Ivy lies**. Camille is unchallenged, so Ivy is lying, and her claim about Lachlan is false.
  
- **Gracie** says **Lachlan lies**, but **Elara** says **Gracie lies**. Elara is unchallenged, so Gracie is lying, and her claim about Lachlan is false.
  
- **Saphira** says **Lachlan lies**, but **Jayden** says **Saphira lies**. Jayden is unchallenged, so Saphira is lying, and her claim about Lachlan is false.
  
- **Jack** says **Lachlan lies**, but **Freya** says **Jack lies**. Freya is unchallenged, so Jack is lying, and his claim about Lachlan is false.
  
- **Rylan** says **Lachlan lies**, but **Everlee** says **Rylan lies**. Everlee is unchallenged, so Rylan is lying, and his claim about Lachlan is false.

Since the accusations against Lachlan from Lian, Ivy, Gracie, Saphira, Jack, and Rylan are false, we disregard their claims.

**Conclusion:**

- **Tatum** and **Joseph** are truthful in claiming **Lachlan lies**.
- **Lachlan** is lying when he says **the milk is spoiled**.

1. **Linnea** says the television is **on**.
2. **Meadow**, **Brantley**, **Lainey**, and **Reagan** each claim that **Linnea lies**. There is no testimony against Meadow or Brantley, so we accept their statements as true.

End your answer with: ""Answer: yes or no""","To solve this puzzle, let's analyze the statements step by step, considering the rule that witnesses should be believed unless there is testimony that they might lie.

**Witnesses with no testimony against them (trustworthy witnesses):**
- **Lucas (Lu)** says that **Kaylani (K)** lies.
- **Layne (La)** says that **Kaylani (K)** lies.
- **Stella (S)** says that **Tessa (Te)** lies.
- **Ivan (I)** says that **Kenna (Ke)** lies.
- **Peyton (P)** says that **Zaylee (Z)** lies.

**Analyzing their statements:**

1. **Lucas (trustworthy)** says **Kaylani lies** ⇒ **Kaylani** might be lying.
2. **Layne (trustworthy)** says **Kaylani lies** ⇒ Further suggests **Kaylani** is lying.
3. **Ivan (trustworthy)** says **Kenna lies** ⇒ **Kenna** is lying.
   - **Kenna (liar)** says **Daxton lies** ⇒ Since **Kenna** is lying, **Daxton** tells the truth.
   - **Daxton (truthful)** says **Kaylani lies** ⇒ Again, **Kaylani** is lying.
4. **Stella (trustworthy)** says **Tessa lies** ⇒ **Tessa** is lying.
   - **Tessa (liar)** says **Carson lies** ⇒ Since **Tessa** is lying, **Carson** tells the truth.
   - **Carson (truthful)** says **Kaylani lies** ⇒ Again, **Kaylani** is lying.
5. **Peyton (trustworthy)** says **Zaylee lies** ⇒ **Zaylee** is lying.
   - **Zaylee (liar)** says **Arabella lies** ⇒ Since **Zaylee** is lying, **Arabella** tells the truth.
   - **Arabella (truthful)** says **Camila lies** ⇒ **Camila** is lying.
   - **Camila (liar)** says **Briar lies** ⇒ Since **Camila** is lying, **Briar** tells the truth.
   - **Briar (truthful)** says **Daniel lies** ⇒ **Daniel** is lying.
   - **Daniel (liar)** says **Kaylani lies** ⇒ Since **Daniel** is lying, **Kaylani** tells the truth.

We have a contradiction because trustworthy witnesses suggest both that **Kaylani** is lying and telling the truth. However, the majority of trustworthy witnesses (Lucas, Layne, Daxton, Carson) independently indicate that **Kaylani** is lying, while only one trustworthy chain (through Briar) suggests she is telling the truth.

Given the weight of evidence from multiple trustworthy witnesses pointing to **Kaylani** lying, it is more reasonable to conclude that **Kaylani** is lying and the phone is not ringing.

- Maelyn says that Odalys lies.

First, we check if anyone accuses Isla and Leah of lying. No one does, which means we should trust their testimonies. Since both Isla and Leah, who are trustworthy witnesses, claim that Claire lies, we conclude that Claire is lying about the wind being strong.

Here’s a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Azaria** says the lights are bright.
2. **Malia** and **Alia** claim that **Azaria** lies. Since no one accuses Malia or Alia of lying, we believe them. Therefore, **Azaria** is lying about the lights being bright.

In summary:
- **Malia** and **Alia** (trustworthy witnesses) say **Azaria** lies.
- **Lian** is discredited by **Ethan**.

1. **Eliana says the store is open.**
   - She is the initial witness.
   
2. **Eva says that Eliana lies.**
   - Since no one claims that Eva lies, we believe Eva.
   - Therefore, Eliana is lying about the store being open.

3. **Eli says that Eliana lies.**
   - **Maxine says that Eli lies.**
     - No one says Maxine lies, so we believe Maxine.
     - Therefore, Eli is lying, and Eliana is telling the truth.
   - Now we have conflicting information about Eliana's honesty.

                       - No one says Tilly lies, so we believe Tilly.
                       - Therefore, Callista is lying.
                   - Since Callista lies about Samantha lying, Samantha tells the truth.
                 - Samantha says Zoe lies. Thus, Zoe is lying.
               - Zoe lies about Joshua lying, so Joshua tells the truth.
             - Joshua says Brinley lies. Therefore, Brinley is lying.
           - Brinley lies about Allison lying, so Allison tells the truth.
         - Allison says Lucy lies. Therefore, Lucy is lying.
       - Lucy lies about Tenley lying, so Tenley tells the truth.
     - Tenley says Adira lies. Therefore, Adira is lying.
   - Adira lies about Zaila lying, so Zaila tells the truth.
   - Zaila says Eliana lies, confirming Eva's claim.

Combining this with Eva's unchallenged testimony that Eliana lies, we have strong evidence that Eliana is lying about the store being open.

- **Witnesses should be believed unless there is testimony that they might lie.**
  
Let's analyze each witness's statement step by step:

1. **Robert says the bread is fresh.**
   - Robert is the initial source stating that the bread is fresh.

2. **Ruby claims that Robert lies.**
   - No one claims that Ruby lies.
   - Therefore, **we believe Ruby**, and conclude that **Robert lies**.

3. **Aracely claims that Robert lies.**
   - **Samuel claims that Aracely lies.**
   - No one claims that Samuel lies.
   - Therefore, **we believe Samuel**, and conclude that **Aracely lies**, meaning Aracely's claim is false, so Robert tells the truth.

End your answer with: ""Answer: yes or no""","To determine whether the grass is wet, let's analyze the witnesses' statements step by step, following the rule that witnesses should be believed unless there is testimony that they might lie.

1. **Perla** says that the grass is wet.
2. **Elira** claims that Perla lies. Since no one accuses Elira of lying, we accept her testimony. Therefore, **Perla is lying**, so the grass is **not** wet.
3. **Peyton** also claims that Perla lies. However, **Zoe** (who is unchallenged) claims that Peyton lies. So Peyton is lying about Perla lying, which means Perla tells the truth. This contradicts our earlier conclusion.
4. **Lynx** claims that Perla lies. **Josie** claims that Lynx lies, but **Anabella** (unchallenged) claims that Josie lies. Therefore, Josie is lying about Lynx lying, so Lynx is telling the truth about Perla lying.
5. **Kaylee** claims that Perla lies. **Jenevieve** claims that Kaylee lies, but her credibility is challenged by a chain of witnesses. Ultimately, **Mariah** (unchallenged) claims that **Elysia** lies, leading us back to trust **Jenevieve**. So Kaylee is lying about Perla lying, suggesting Perla tells the truth.

We now have conflicting conclusions:
- **Elira** and **Lynx** (both credible) say Perla lies (grass is not wet).
- **Zoe** and **Jenevieve** (also credible through reasoning) suggest Perla tells the truth (grass is wet).

Since credible witnesses lead to contradictory conclusions, and considering that **Elira**'s unchallenged testimony directly states that Perla lies, we conclude that Perla is lying when she says the grass is wet. Therefore, the grass is not wet.

**Witnesses who say the road is clear:**
- **Ayleen**: Says the road is clear.

**Witnesses who claim Ayleen lies:**
1. **Stormy**: Says Ayleen lies. No one accuses Stormy of lying. Therefore, Stormy is believed, and Ayleen is considered to be lying.
2. **Kyla**: Says Ayleen lies. Owen accuses Kyla of lying, but Mason accuses Owen of lying. Since no one accuses Mason of lying, Mason is believed, making Owen a liar. Therefore, Kyla is telling the truth, reinforcing that Ayleen lies.
3. **Sariyah**: Says Ayleen lies. Adrian accuses Sariyah of lying, but Renata accuses Adrian of lying. Since no one accuses Renata of lying, Renata is believed, making Adrian a liar. Therefore, Sariyah is telling the truth, again indicating that Ayleen lies.
4. **Kyson**: Says Ayleen lies. Henry accuses Kyson of lying, Lynx accuses Henry of lying, Olivia accuses Lynx of lying, and Isabella accuses Olivia of lying. No one accuses Isabella of lying, so Isabella is believed, making Olivia a liar, which means Lynx tells the truth, making Henry a liar, and thus Kyson tells the truth.

1. **Witness Alaina says the grass is green.**
2. **Witness Emma claims that Alaina lies.**
   - No one says Emma lies.

   - Conclusion reinforces that the grass is **not** green.

4. **Witness Madelyn claims that Ruby lies about Alaina lying.**
   - No one says Madelyn lies.

Question: is the tree tall?
End your answer with: ""Answer: yes or no""","To determine if the tree is tall, we need to assess whether Kynlee is telling the truth when she says, ""The tree is tall."" Witnesses are considered truthful unless there is testimony that they might lie.

1. **Kynlee** says the tree is tall.

2. **Jayden**, **Keely**, **Inez**, and **Wyatt** claim that **Kynlee** lies.

3. For each of these witnesses, we need to see if there's credible testimony that they might lie.

   - **Keely** is said to lie by **Harmony**.
     - **Harmony** is claimed to lie by **Marlee**.
       - No one says **Marlee** lies, so we trust **Marlee**, meaning **Harmony** lies, so **Keely** tells the truth. Therefore, **Kynlee** lies.

   - **Inez** is said to lie by **Norah**.
     - **Norah** is claimed to lie by **Calliope**.
       - No one says **Calliope** lies, so we trust **Calliope**, meaning **Norah** lies, so **Inez** tells the truth. Therefore, **Kynlee** lies.

   - **Wyatt** is said to lie by **Briar**.
     - **Briar** is claimed to lie by **Callie**.
       - **Callie** is claimed to lie by **Ayla**.
         - **Ayla** is claimed to lie by **Mallory**.
           - **Mallory** is claimed to lie by **Eithne**.
             - **Eithne** is claimed to lie by **Kaylin**.
               - No one says **Kaylin** lies, so we trust **Kaylin**, meaning **Eithne** lies, so **Mallory** tells the truth, leading back to **Wyatt** telling the truth. Therefore, **Kynlee** lies.

4. Since we have credible witnesses stating that **Kynlee** lies, and no credible testimony that these witnesses lie, we conclude that **Kynlee** is lying about the tree being tall.

End your answer with: ""Answer: yes or no""","To determine whether the cat is meowing, we need to assess the credibility of each witness based on the provided testimonies and the rule: **Witnesses should be believed unless there is testimony that they might lie.**

Let's break down the statements:

1. **Holden** says *the cat is meowing*.
2. **Zana** says that **Holden lies**.
   - No one says that **Zana** lies. Therefore, we believe **Zana** and conclude that **Holden might lie**.
3. **Eliana** says that **Holden lies**.
   - **Owen** says that **Eliana lies**.
   - **Fiera** says that **Owen lies**.
     - No one says that **Fiera** lies, so we believe **Fiera**. Thus, **Owen might lie**.
     - Since **Owen** might lie, his claim that **Eliana lies** is unreliable.
     - Therefore, **Eliana's** statement stands: **Holden lies**.
4. **Lillian** says that **Holden lies**.
   - **Rhea** says that **Lillian lies**.
   - **Maelynn** says that **Rhea lies**.
     - No one says that **Maelynn** lies, so we believe **Maelynn**. Thus, **Rhea might lie**.
     - Since **Rhea** might lie, her claim that **Lillian lies** is unreliable.
     - Therefore, **Lillian's** statement stands: **Holden lies**.
5. **Azalea** says that **Holden lies**.
   - **Alexander** says that **Azalea lies**.
   - **Lucian** says that **Alexander lies**.
     - No one says that **Lucian** lies, so we believe **Lucian**. Thus, **Alexander might lie**.
     - Since **Alexander** might lie, his claim that **Azalea lies** is unreliable.
     - Therefore, **Azalea's** statement stands: **Holden lies**.
6. **Anaya** says that **Holden lies**.
   - **Talia** says that **Anaya lies**.
   - **Bria** says that **Talia lies**.
   - **Adalyn** says that **Bria lies**.
     - No one says that **Adalyn** lies, so we believe **Adalyn**. Thus, **Bria might lie**.
     - Since **Bria** might lie, her claim that **Talia lies** is unreliable.
     - Therefore, **Talia's** statement stands: **Anaya lies**.
     - Since **Talia** claims **Anaya lies**, and we believe **Talia**, **Anaya's** statement is unreliable.
     - So we cannot confirm **Anaya's** claim about **Holden**.
     
**Summary:**
- **Holden says the cat is meowing**, but multiple witnesses (**Zana**, **Eliana**, **Lillian**, **Azalea**) say that **Holden lies**, and their credibility remains intact.
- There are attempts to discredit these witnesses, but those attempts come from witnesses whose credibility is undermined by others whose credibility is intact.

**Conclusion:**
- Since credible witnesses say that **Holden lies**, we conclude that **Holden is lying** about the cat meowing.
- Therefore, **the cat is not meowing**.

Question: is the air humid?
End your answer with: ""Answer: yes or no""","To solve this puzzle, we need to determine whether Jace is telling the truth when he says that the air is humid. According to the given rules, witnesses should be believed unless there is testimony that they might lie.

First, Witness Jace says the air is humid.

**Evidence that Jace might lie:**
- Witness Zaniyah says that Jace lies. No one says that Zaniyah lies, so we believe her.
- Witness Hannah says that Jace lies. However, Witness Olwen says that Hannah lies.
  - Witness Zanna says that Olwen lies, but Witness Odalys says that Zanna lies. No one says that Odalys lies, so we believe Odalys. This means Zanna is lying, so Olwen tells the truth, and Hannah lies. If Hannah lies about Jace lying, then Jace tells the truth.
  
This creates a conflict:
- From Zaniyah's unchallenged testimony, Jace lies.
- From Olwen's testimony (supported by Odalys), Hannah lies, so Jace tells the truth.

**Resolving the Conflict:**
Since witnesses should be believed unless there is testimony against them, and Zaniyah's testimony that Jace lies is unchallenged, we must accept that Jace lies. The conflicting chain involving Hannah is resolved by acknowledging that Hannah's testimony is compromised (she lies according to Olwen) but Zaniyah's is not.

**Conclusion:**
Jace is lying when he says the air is humid. Therefore, the air is not humid.

Question: is the plane landing?
End your answer with: ""Answer: yes or no""","To solve this reasoning puzzle, we'll analyze the statements made by the witnesses step by step, keeping in mind that witnesses are believed unless there's testimony that they might lie.

1. **Callen** says the plane is landing.
2. **Laila** claims that **Callen** lies.
   - No one says **Laila** might lie, so we believe her.
   - Therefore, **Callen** is lying, and the plane is **not** landing.
3. **Suri** also claims that **Callen** lies.
   - Our previous conclusion already has **Callen** lying, so this supports it.
4. **Asher** claims that **Suri** lies.
   - No one says **Asher** might lie, so we believe him.
   - Therefore, **Suri** is lying about **Callen** lying.
   - However, this contradicts our earlier acceptance of **Suri's** testimony.
5. **Ashlynn** claims that **Asher** lies.
   - We believe **Ashlynn** unless someone says she might lie.
6. **Selah** claims that **Ashlynn** lies.
   - We believe **Selah** (no testimony against her), so **Ashlynn** is lying.
   - Therefore, **Asher** is telling the truth, which again contradicts our earlier conclusion.
   
We encounter a contradiction here. Continuing this pattern with the other witnesses leads to similar contradictions, indicating that the information can't consistently support both outcomes.

Given that accepting some witnesses leads to contradictions, and since we initially have testimony that **Callen** lies (from **Laila**, whom we believe), the most consistent conclusion is that **Callen** is lying, and the plane is **not** landing.

2. **Gracie** claims **""Austin lies.""**
   - **Maylin** says **""Gracie lies.""**
     - No one accuses **Maylin** of lying.
     - Therefore, **Maylin** tells the truth, so **Gracie** is lying.

3. **Juniper** claims **""Austin lies.""**
   - **Olivia** says **""Juniper lies.""**
     - No one accuses **Olivia** of lying.

4. **Aria** claims **""Austin lies.""**
   - **Teagan** says **""Aria lies.""**
     - No one accuses **Teagan** of lying.

     - Therefore, since **Zaylee** tells the truth, **Austin** is lying.

**Conclusion:**

- **Kendra** and **Zaylee** are truthful when they say **""Austin lies.""**
- There is no testimony against **Leila** or **Aris**, so their statements are accepted.

- **Katherine** says: *Avani lies*.
- **Leena** says: *Katherine lies*.
- **Skylar** says: *Leena lies*.
  - We believe Skylar, so Leena lies, Katherine tells the truth, and Avani lies.

- **Eva** says: *Avani lies*.
- **Raelynn** says: *Eva lies*.
- **Alessia** says: *Raelynn lies*.
- **Aidan** says: *Alessia lies*.
- **John** says: *Aidan lies*.
  - We believe John, so Aidan lies, Alessia tells the truth, Raelynn lies, Eva tells the truth, and Avani lies.

In all cases, the testimonies ultimately indicate that **Avani lies** when she says *the ocean is deep*. Therefore, the ocean is **not** deep.

Witness Livia says that the water is cold.
Witness Briar claims that witness Livia lies.
Witness Rhea claims that witness Briar lies.
Witness Gracie claims that witness Rhea lies.
Witness Cora claims that witness Gracie lies.
Witness Keira claims that witness Cora lies.
Witness Tatum claims that witness Livia lies.
Witness Tinsley claims that witness Tatum lies.
Witness Marigold claims that witness Tinsley lies.
Witness Amelia claims that witness Marigold lies.
Witness Madelyn claims that witness Amelia lies.
Witness Zaiden claims that witness Madelyn lies.
Witness Ashlynn claims that witness Zaiden lies.
Witness Jada claims that witness Ashlynn lies.
Witness Jeremiah claims that witness Jada lies.
Question: is the water cold?
End your answer with: ""Answer: yes or no""","To determine whether the water is cold, we need to assess the credibility of the witnesses based on the given rule: **Witnesses should be believed unless there is testimony that they might lie**.

Let's examine the statements step by step:

1. **Livia says that the water is cold.**
   - We should believe Livia unless someone says she lies.

2. **Briar claims that Livia lies.**
   - Now, Livia's credibility is challenged by Briar.

3. **Rhea claims that Briar lies.**
   - Briar's credibility is challenged by Rhea.

4. **Gracie claims that Rhea lies.**
   - Rhea's credibility is challenged by Gracie.

5. **Cora claims that Gracie lies.**
   - Gracie's credibility is challenged by Cora.

6. **Keira claims that Cora lies.**
   - Cora's credibility is challenged by Keira.

7. **Tatum claims that Livia lies.**
   - Another challenge to Livia's credibility from Tatum.

8. **Tinsley claims that Tatum lies.**
   - Tatum's credibility is challenged by Tinsley.

9. **Marigold claims that Tinsley lies.**
   - Tinsley's credibility is challenged by Marigold.

10. **Amelia claims that Marigold lies.**
    - Marigold's credibility is challenged by Amelia.

11. **Madelyn claims that Amelia lies.**
    - Amelia's credibility is challenged by Madelyn.

12. **Zaiden claims that Madelyn lies.**
    - Madelyn's credibility is challenged by Zaiden.

13. **Ashlynn claims that Zaiden lies.**
    - Zaiden's credibility is challenged by Ashlynn.

14. **Jada claims that Ashlynn lies.**
    - Ashlynn's credibility is challenged by Jada.

15. **Jeremiah claims that Jada lies.**
    - Jada's credibility is challenged by Jeremiah.

Now, let's resolve the credibility chain starting from the end:

- **Jeremiah** has no one accusing him of lying, so we believe him when he says **Jada lies**.
- Since **Jada lies**, her statement that **Ashlynn lies** is false. So, **Ashlynn does not lie**.
- Therefore, we believe **Ashlynn** when she says **Zaiden lies**.
- Since **Zaiden lies**, his claim that **Madelyn lies** is false. So, **Madelyn does not lie**.
- We believe **Madelyn** when she says **Amelia lies**.
- Since **Amelia lies**, her claim that **Marigold lies** is false. So, **Marigold does not lie**.
- We believe **Marigold** when she says **Tinsley lies**.
- Since **Tinsley lies**, her claim that **Tatum lies** is false. So, **Tatum does not lie**.
- We believe **Tatum** when she says **Livia lies**.

Separately, from the other chain:
- **Keira** has no one accusing her of lying, so we believe her when she says **Cora lies**.
- Since **Cora lies**, her claim that **Gracie lies** is false. So, **Gracie does not lie**.
- We believe **Gracie** when she says **Rhea lies**.
- Since **Rhea lies**, her claim that **Briar lies** is false. So, **Briar does not lie**.
- We believe **Briar** when she says **Livia lies**.

Both **Tatum** and **Briar**, whom we have determined to be truthful, claim that **Livia lies**. Therefore, **Livia's statement that the water is cold is a lie**.

0,15,"(7, 7)","The following is a reasoning puzzle. Witnesses should be believed unless there is testimony that they might lie. A Now consider the following facts:
Witness Kamryn says that the teacher is speaking.
Witness Melina claims that witness Kamryn lies.
Witness Daisy claims that witness Melina lies.
Witness Lucian claims that witness Daisy lies.
Witness Alia claims that witness Lucian lies.
Witness Jordan claims that witness Alia lies.
Witness Raya claims that witness Jordan lies.
Witness Amayah claims that witness Raya lies.
Witness Kaylani claims that witness Kamryn lies.
Witness Yara claims that witness Kaylani lies.
Witness Eli claims that witness Yara lies.
Witness Isaac claims that witness Eli lies.
Witness Aaron claims that witness Isaac lies.
Witness Amari claims that witness Aaron lies.
Witness Adalyn claims that witness Amari lies.
Question: is the teacher speaking?
End your answer with: ""Answer: yes or no""","To determine if the teacher is speaking, we need to assess the credibility of Witness Kamryn, who says that the teacher is speaking. However, Witnesses Melina and Kaylani both claim that Kamryn lies. We are told to believe witnesses unless there is testimony that they might lie.

Let's analyze the chain of testimonies:

1. **Witness Melina says Kamryn lies.**
   - **Daisy says Melina lies.**
     - **Lucian says Daisy lies.**
       - **Alia says Lucian lies.**
         - **Jordan says Alia lies.**
           - **Raya says Jordan lies.**
             - **Amayah says Raya lies.**
               - No one says Amayah lies; thus, Amayah is credible.

Since Amayah is credible, Raya lies. Therefore, Jordan tells the truth, meaning Alia lies. This continues back, making Lucian truthful, Daisy lying, and ultimately Melina truthful. Therefore, Melina's statement that Kamryn lies is credible.

2. **Witness Kaylani says Kamryn lies.**
   - **Yara says Kaylani lies.**
     - **Eli says Yara lies.**
       - **Isaac says Eli lies.**
         - **Aaron says Isaac lies.**
           - **Amari says Aaron lies.**
             - **Adalyn says Amari lies.**
               - No one says Adalyn lies; thus, Adalyn is credible.

Since Adalyn is credible, Amari lies. Therefore, Aaron tells the truth, meaning Isaac lies. This continues back, making Eli truthful, Yara lying, and ultimately Kaylani truthful. Therefore, Kaylani's statement that Kamryn lies is credible.

Both Melina and Kaylani are credible witnesses stating that Kamryn lies. Therefore, Kamryn is lying when she says the teacher is speaking.
